Furthermore,VAT is the hypothesized driver of obesity-related Alzheimer's disease and Related Dementias (AD\\/ADRD), asall the aforementioned conditions\\/diseases are related to higher risk of AD\\/ADRD and poor brain health. Thebasis for this hypothesis is research that has elegantly described the intimate nature of VAT as a powerful,upstream metabolic driver of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension; all conditions that precipitatethe etiology of AD\\/ADRD and changes in brain morphology related to AD\\/ADRD. Other related researchsuggests that total body fat, and more specifically subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), may be relatively lessimportant in the pathophysiology of AD\\/ADRD. Despite this burgeoning framework of knowledge, muchremains unknown about the relationship between abdominal VAT and SAT levels with AD\\/ADRD ? a criticalgap in the evidence base since further insight resulting from research on this topic would have majorimplications related to the importance of body composition and obesity in AD\\/ADRD prevention. As part of anactive RO1, Dr. Odegaard and his team derived and validated repeated measures of VAT and SAT with noveltechnology in the existing Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) cohort,providing a solution to the basic data access problem. This sub-cohort is a minority enriched, analyticlongitudinal cohort in the WHI with scans at baseline (N=10,607), year 3 (N=8,939), year 6 (N=8,239), and year9 (N=4,595). We are now proposing to extend the framework originally created to address essential questionsrelated to cardiometabolic disease risk by leveraging the WHI study design and structure and integrating thedata with the WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) data, including 860 women with repeated, valid cognitiveassessments and > 80 women with brain MRI's. This project leverages two significant scientific resourceswithin the WHI and will address fundamental hypotheses that link visceral adiposity with AD\\/ADRD risk andbrain health in postmenopausal women.--PROJECT NARRATIVEThis supplemental proposal leverages an unparalleled resource developed by the parent grant in data ofabdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) depots from existing Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans. By linking this data to another ancillary study within the Women'sHealth Initiative (WHI); the WHIMS ? WHI Memory Study; we will address essential questions on the topic ofabdominal adiposity\\/body composition; and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) risk inpostmenopausal women as they age. The results will begin to put in context the importance of abdominaladipose tissue depots in ADRD risk and the potential for targeted interventions and prevention efforts.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary\\/AbstractAge is a major risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) for which the pathophysiological processesmay begin more than a decade prior to the onset of symptoms. We have found that AD is associated withepigenetic biomarkers of age ('epigenetic clock') based on DNA methylation levels. However, it is unknown towhat extent existing and novel epigenetic biomarkers can capture the true biological age of the brain andwhether epigenetic changes mediate the risk of chronological change on AD susceptibility. To address thesequestions, there is a critical need for a comprehensive large scale study of DNA methylation in the context ofAD neuropathology both in humans and suitable mouse models of AD. The resulting data will allow us andothers to characterize age-related DNA methylation changes that associate with and contribute to thepathologic changes of AD. The overarching goals of this proposal are a) to establish the role and impact ofepigenetic brain aging in the development and progression of AD and b) to develop novel biomarkers orcombinations of biomarkers that can be used to characterize different types of AD.Using a well-validated Infinium DNA methylation array that applies to both humans and preclinical models, thisproposal will generate high-quality DNA methylation profiles from human postmortem brain tissues and murinemodels of AD. To develop these biomarkers, genome-wide DNA methylation data will be integrated withcomplementary neuropathological findings - synaptic loss, amyloid deposition, abnormally phosphorylated tau,neurofibrillary tangle formation, neuro-inflammatory markers to arrive at epigenetic biomarkers of ADneuropathology and brain aging.The investigative team has broad expertise conducting cross disciplinary research spanning Alzheimer'sdisease, neurobiology of aging, epigenomics, mouse models of AD, and biomarker development.By leveraging a large sample size (four brain regions from human, mouse, and rat), a battery of establishedmeasures of neuropathology, clinical history and state of the art statistical methodologies, we will develop andevaluate epigenetic biomarkers of brain aging that promise to elucidate epigenetic risk factors for ADdevelopment and progression. These findings have the potential to both further our understanding ofepigenetic mechanisms underlying AD and epigenetic biomarkers for future therapeutic interventions.These investigations will result in (a) the validation and development of DNAm biomarkers for clinical andpreclinical studies of Alzheimer's disease and (b) context-of-use statements that fully describe the purpose anduse of each biomarker.--Project NarrativeWe will develop and optimize DNA methylation biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease for clinical and preclinical studiesof interventions that delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Sudden changes in cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, especially diet quality, physical activity attainment, andsleep hygiene, commonly accompany acute medical events such as surgeries among middle aged and olderadults. These sudden changes are associated with poorer long-term cognitive and brain outcomes. The Covid-19 pandemic caused a different version of sudden change: large numbers of healthy adults became confined tothe home for extended periods of time, changed their patterns of food shopping, restaurant eating, sports andexercise engagement, and sleep due to home confinement orders and their lingering after-effects. The Covid19pandemic is promoting a new and different form of sudden change in CV and lifestyle factors, the healthimpacts of which are not clear. Our immediate goal in this supplement is to rigorously assess the extent ofsudden CV risk factor changes associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, with a long-term goal of assessingrelationships between such cardiovascular changes and cognitive and brain changes in a large epidemiologicalcohort. This supplement will use validated technologies to objectively assess Covid-19-related changes to diet,physical activity, and sleep among black and white men and women in mid-life who have participated in theBogalusa Heart Study (BHS) participants, and already consented to longitudinal assessment of CV risk factors,brain outcomes, and cognitive outcomes via their enrollment in the parent grant (RO1 AG041200). We willprovide 250 BHS participants with wrist-worn accelerometers capable of assessing sleep quality and physicalactivity attainment (ActiGraph WGT3X+) as well as Remote Food Photography Methods\\u00c2\\u00a9 implemented via asmartphone application (the SmartIntake\\u00c2\\u00ae app). Physical activity and sleep quality will be objectivelymeasured over a 7-day period, and food intake over a 4-day period. This data, together with previousassessments of diet, physical activity, and sleep quality from earlier sweeps through the cohort, will position usto calibrate and analyze changes in these three CV risk factors due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This data willposition us to assess effects of such sudden CV risk changes on cognitive and brain outcomes, as well as racedisparities in this association, to clarify the long-term public health impact of pandemic-related lifestylechanges. The data collected by this supplement efficiently leverages the parent grant (focused on CV risks andbrain outcomes) in a population with substantial minority representation (35% African-American) and couldidentify targets for a novel lifestyle intervention to be rapidly deployed and scaled in a future pandemic as away to preserve health. Leveraging the long-standing NIH investment in the Bogalusa Heart Study is theoptimal approach for investigating the effects of pandemic-related sudden CV risk factor changes on cognitiveand brain health.--Sudden changes in cardiovascular (CV) risk factors; especially diet quality; physical activity attainment; andsleep hygiene; have occurred due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Pepper Center mission to identify factors thatprevent disablement and promote enablement in older adults. To that end, a defining feature of Alzheimer?sdisease (AD) and its related dementias (ADRD) is the accumulation of amyloid-beta protein in extracellularplaques within the brain and subsequent neuronal loss. Thus, the dominant hypothesis for AD pathogenesis,the ?amyloid hypothesis,? postulates that amyloid-beta accumulation is the primary event leading to AD. Mostcandidate treatments have targeted amyloid-beta; however, the unsuccessful trials of these treatmentschallenge the amyloid hypothesis and motivate the need for new intervention targets. Recent epidemiologicdata also support alternative hypotheses for AD pathogenesis. Specifically, observational studies haveconsistently shown that AD and dementia are inversely related to cancer. This ?inverse comorbidity? may bedue to pathogenesis at opposite ends of a shared biological mechanism. Two proposed mechanisms to explaininverse comorbidity between dementia and cancer are energy metabolism and inflammation. The scientificpremise for these mechanisms is supported by findings that neuronal glycolysis is downregulated in AD andupregulated in cancer cells; also, higher markers of systemic inflammation are observed in persons with AD,whereas inflammatory complexes may promote or inhibit tumor growth depending on context. However,epidemiological studies of dementia and cancer have not rigorously investigated whether energy metabolismand inflammation explain this inverse comorbidity. Moreover, studies of inverse comorbidity are vulnerable tobiases from selective survival because persons with cancer are more likely to die before dementia onset thanpersons without cancer. Limitations of current statistical methods are a key barrier to accurately quantifying thestrength of inverse association between dementia and cancer and to identifying markers of biologicalmechanisms that may explain inverse comorbidity. Therefore, new statistical methods are needed. Thespecific aims of this proposal are to 1) quantify the association between incident dementia and cancer overtime and 2) test the relation of metabolomic and inflammatory markers jointly with incident dementia andcancer. To achieve these goals, we will adapt and refine novel structural models for bivariate time-to-eventdata and apply them to harmonized archived data on over 10,000 adults aged at least 65 years enrolled inthree prospective cohort studies (Health, Aging and Body Composition; Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study;and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures). We hypothesize that even after addressing selective survival, dementiaand cancer have an inverse association that is explained, in part, by markers of energy metabolism andinflammation. Novel statistical methods will provide a rigorous framework to test inverse comorbidity and will bemade available to the Pepper Center network. The ultimate public health impact of this project is potential fornovel candidate biomarkers to inform development of new strategies to treat or prevent AD\\/ADRD.--Most of the over 44 million persons worldwide living with dementia have Alzheimer?s Disease (AD) or itsrelated dementias (ADRD). Unsuccessful trials for AD treatments and evidence from population-based studieshave led to challenges to longstanding hypotheses of the cause of AD and a search for alternatives. Wehypothesize that an inverse relationship between dementia and cancer is the source an alternative biologicalmechanism; thus; we propose to leverage data from over 10;000 older adults to develop new methods and toidentify markers of candidate mechanisms to inform potential targets of intervention to prevent and treatAD\\/ADRD.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Overall: Project SummaryThis is a renewal application for the Johns Hopkins University Older Americans Independence Center (JHUOAIC).

At end-of-life, hospice is a model of care that aims to ameliorate disability byoptimizing quality of life for people who are dying and their families. Virtually all research on end of life care ofpersons living with dementia, especially in hospice, has focused on the dementia as a principal diagnosis andproximate cause of death. Yet older persons at the end of life frequently have many co-existing conditions.Many hospice enrollees whose indication for hospice care is a diagnosis other than dementia still have co-existing dementia. The co-existence of dementia with hospice indications such as cancer or congestive heartfailure is likely to have profound implications for care and outcomes. To address the goals of the National Planto Address Alzheimer's Disease to enhance care quality and expand supports for caregivers and those withdementia, we need to ensure that end-of-life quality of life is optimized for people with dementia, whetherdementia is the primary cause of death, or co-exists with another end of life condition.The overarching goal of the UCSF Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) is to prevent late-lifedisability when possible, and to improve the quality of life of older people with disability when prevention is notpossible (amelioration). The proposed administrative supplement extends this goal specifically to vulnerableolder adults who have Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. This proposal fits within the conceptualframework that guides the UCSF OAIC, which holds that care for elders with disability and dementia mustconsider the wider medical and social context. We will leverage the expertise of the OAIC Data Analysis Coreand the nationally representative National Health Aging and Trends Study (NHATS) to shed light on anunderstudied population: hospice enrollees with comorbid dementia.Our proposal aims to quantify and compare characteristics and outcomes of older adults dying with comorbiddementia while receiving hospice care for another condition contextualized in comparison to two groups: A)hospice recipients with a primary diagnosis of dementia and B) hospice decedents with neither a primarydiagnosis of dementia nor comorbid dementia (e.g. without dementia). Data from the ADRD supplement wouldprovide critical preliminary data for a compelling NIA ADRD R01 application that uses NHATS to examine end-of-life experiences and costs for persons dying in hospice with comorbid dementia. Our findings will helpidentify opportunities to improve hospice care and policy for hospice decedents dying with or from dementia.Such research aligns with NIA strategic directions for 2020 to support research that improves ourunderstanding of ADRD (goal D) and to inform intervention development and policy decisions (goal E).--PROJECT NARRATIVEPeople with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia syndromes deserve hospice care that amelioratesdisability and optimizes quality of life for people who are dying and their families.

SUMMARY \\/ ABSTRACTThe ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study successfully established a cohort of 19,114 healthy older adults in the U.S. and Australia who were free of Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias (ADRD), cardiovascular disease, and significant physical disability at baseline, and tested whether the exposure to 5 years of low-dose aspirin (LDA) would prolong dementia-free and disability-free survival. Although the intervention period has ended, the establishment of this large and diverse cohort, coupled with unprecedented findings from the intervention period, has created a rare opportunity for continued surveillance of important health outcomes and the antecedents that jeopardize disability-free survival in this aging population; especially ADRD and cancer. Personal health information will be collected annually from participants, and major clinical events will be confirmed through case documentation prepared for expert adjudication of ADRD (and sub-type classification into Alzheimer?s disease and non- ADRD), cancer (incident, metastatic, type, stage and death), and other key health outcomes including death. Observational follow-up of large, long-term aging studies such as ASPREE benefit from continuity, experience and leadership with ADRD expertise. In this funding request, the ASPREE leadership team proposes to extend follow-up of the participants in both the U.S. and Australia for an additional five years (i.e., ?ASPREE-XT?), which will greatly enrich an already unique, and highly valuable international research asset focused on prolonging healthy independent life in the elderly, free of dementia and disability. The infrastructure needed to accomplish this will rely on the continuity, leadership, and experience of the U.S. and Australian Coordinating Centers that have proven their success in the ASPREE trial through the exemplary study conduct and completion. This includes bi-national standardized training and accreditation to ensure the consistent administration of the annual cognitive battery and triggered dementia assessments which include the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale. The Bi-National Administrative Core will deploy the infrastructure and governance necessary to accomplish the aims of the ASPREE-XT longitudinal cohort study, including to understand the legacy effects of low dose aspirin on cognitive decline, ADRD, disability and cancer prevention. The overarching goal of the Bi-National Administrative Core is to foster the dynamic exchange of information, ideas, and data arising from all Cores to provide insight into factors that may extend dementia-free and disability-free survival of older adults.--n\\/a\"},{\"abstract\":\"CORE A. PARTICIPANT MEASURES AND ASSESSMENTSSUMMARY\\/ABSTRACTDuring the course of the ASPREE study, a vast amount of clinical, physical function, cognitive and quality of lifedata (~26 million data values) were collected from 19,114 participants by trained staff, resulting in excellentparticipant retention (82% with full involvement at the end of the study), compliance (74% overall) and dataquality (99.6% accuracy). This Core will build on the operational success of ASPREE and provide methodologicaland operational support for all participant-related study activity by coordinating, directing and managing thephysiological and neuropsychological assessments and questionnaires conducted routinely in ASPREE-XTparticipants in both the U.S. and Australia. The Core services will ensure quality, accuracy and thoroughness ofdata collection from participants through the implementation of comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures(SOPs) and to ensure adherence to SOPs, staff in both countries will be trained prior to commencement of studyactivity (see Admin Core). Data provided through the activities of Core A are the clinical nexus for all projects,as Core A will provide clinical endpoint triggers to Core B for follow-up. The longitudinal phenotypic data providedby Core A about ASPREE-XT participants will also be of vital importance for addressing the overall aims of thisU19 through completion of Project analyzes. Specifically, the collection of information related to cancerscreening, cancer incidence, progression, and outcomes are crucial for Project 1 (Cancer). Collection ofcognitive data, depression and dementia endpoints are essential for assessing dementia and mild cognitiveimpairment outcomes in Project 2 (Dementia).

HEALTH EVENTS AND ENDPOINTSSUMMARY \\/ ABSTRACTASPREE ensured clinical rigor through the implementation of an endpoint confirmation process supported by comprehensive clinical document collection and adjudication by clinical experts. This process resulted in the collection and successful adjudication of 8286 clinical endpoint triggers with analysis of these endpoints revealing novel insights about the effect of LDA in an older population, a proportion of whom developed mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Core B will be responsible for the responses to triggers for dementia assessment, such as decline in the 3MS, which lead to a staged process of collecting additional neurocognitive data including the ADAS-COG, functional information, neuroimaging, clinical assessments and laboratory results. Clinical experts then adjudicate cases according to DSM-IV dementia criteria and sub-classify ADRD (Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and related dementia) using NIA-AA criteria into probable AD, possible AD, mixed AD, unlikely AD or vascular dementia. To enable further discovery as part of this U19, Core B will build on the success of ASPREE by processing and adjudicating all key endpoints required for determination of the legacy effects of aspirin, including on cancer and dementia, and the trajectory of initially healthy individuals through the latter years of their lives. Meeting this overall aim requires the provision of high quality clinical data for analyses to assess change in benefit versus risk after aspirin use and specifically on the key health endpoints over the longer term. This Core will receive cancer, dementia, disability, death, cardiovascular disease, stroke and major hemorrhage triggers from completion of study assessments (Core A), medical record review (Core A) and data linkage with National Death Index and other government bodies (Admin Core). Core B will utilize the hub of endpoint coding and clinical document expertise developed during ASPREE to: i) review and code triggers based upon endpoint definitions; ii) collect key clinical information from health records and; iii) prepare case summaries for adjudication. Seven Endpoint Adjudication Subcommittees (sub-EACs) will adjudicate specific events (i.e. cancer, dementia, disability, cardiovascular disease, stroke, major hemorrhage and death) and report via their Chairs to a parent Endpoint Adjudication Committee that holds responsibility for clinical oversight of the adjudication process. Outcomes of adjudication will be entered into AWARD-Adjudicator (Core C) and made available for analyses via the Safe Haven data sharing biostatistics platform (Core C). Thus, through the conduct of additional dementia-specific cognitive, anatomical (neuroimaging) and functional assessments from participants and relevant health records holders for dementia endpoints along with the careful ascertainment of all other clinical endpoints, Core B will provide crucial links between the collection of raw clinical data (Core A), and the storage of clinical outcome information, data management and analyses for all projects (Core C).

BIOSPECIMENS AND SUPPLEMENTARY MEASURES SUMMARY \\/ ABSTRACT The common theme for Core D (Biospecimens & Supplementary Measures) is to conserve and administer existing biospecimens and supplementary data collected during ASPREE, and oversee the continued generation of such data acquired through ASPREE-XT. These data relate to biological (and other) factors that influence health and disease in aging individuals, including neuroimaging for Alzheimer?s disease and related dementia (ADRD) structural pathology, and tumor specimens collected from participants who develop cancers. Core D will ensure that the specimens, images and other supplementary data will be perpetuated for future collaborations; all the while interacting closely with other Cores including Core B for clinical endpoint confirmation and Core C for Data Management. Core D consists of 2 main components which are critical to the success of the Aims proposed in the U19: (1) responsibility for biobanked biological samples including tumor tissue samples; (2) access to data from existing neuroimages to evaluate ADRD vs cerebrovascular pathology. The current and future collections of tumor tissues across both countries will be managed through Core D, which will provide the resources and expertise from the biorepositories in Australia and the U.S., linking closely with the endpoint team in Core B, responsible for providing the cancer cases for adjudication. Core D will also provide oversight of supplementary measures and provision of existing data obtained from biospecimens. Along with the Bi-National Administrative Core, Core D will contribute to the governance and decisions about biomarker access and analyses of samples. In collaboration with Core C through data storage and management, Core D will ensure that biomarker data are disseminated to the U19 for analysis related to cancer, dementia and other outcomes and include, but are not limited to, inflammatory biomarkers and genomic data (such as APOE allele data for ADRD-related studies). Core D will also manage storage and access to the collection of existing longitudinal MRI data to identify changes in neurodegenerative pathology consistent with ADRD versus vascular pathology collected in the following ASPREE substudies: ENVISion (aspirin for the prevention of cognitive decline in the Elderly: a Neuro-Vascular Imaging Study), SNORE-imaging (Study of Neurocognitive outcomes, Radiological and retinal Effects of Aspirin in Sleep Apnea) and NEURO (effect of LDA on number of cererbral microbleeds and correlation with cognitive function).--n\\/a\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project SummaryThis is a supplement to the parent R01 award 5R01AG027060-10: FOXO3 Genotype, InflammAging,Cardiovascular Disease, and Dementia.

A wide array of basic labora-tory, model systems-based, and human investigations around identifying precise metabolic defects as the coreof AD\\/non-AD dementias have emerged. A critical feature of studies attempting to identify a metabolic basis ofneurocognitive dysfunction is the application of a broad assessment of metabolism to a well phenotyped hu-man cohort with dementia and related outcomes. As part of R01AG059729, Drs. Shah, Newman, Murthy andClish have been performing metabolite profiling in a biracial subsample of the Healthy Aging and Body Com-position Study (Health ABC) to identify metabolic pathways relevant to healthy aging. While the parent studyincludes some neurocognitive measures, it only assays a subsample within Health ABC for lipid and lipid me-diators, the key metabolites felt to be relevant to AD and related dementias. Based on data suggesting theemerging importance of inflammation and lipid abnormalities in AD, the study team is requesting supplementalfunds as part of this application to complete lipid and lipid intermediate metabolite profiling to facilitate (1) widerscientific discovery in AD and AD-related phenotypes and (2) integration with other metabolite modes alreadycompleted in Health ABC to provide a wider description of the metabolic abnormalities important in the life-course of neurocognitive dysfunction and AD. We hypothesize that lipid and lipid mediators will be associatedwith phenotypes and phenotypic groups central to AD and may facilitate discovery of potentially intervenablepathways at the heart of AD and AD-related neurocognitive dysfunction. To address this hypothesis, we willperform metabolite profiling in a wider sample size in Health ABC for lipid (C8 positive) and lipid mediators(C18 negative) to identify metabolites and encoded pathways associated with clinical and imaging-based de-mentia endpoints. In Aim 1, we will identify lipid and lipid mediator metabolite signatures associated with sub-sequent cognitive decline, preclinical AD phenotypes, and dementia. In Aim 2, we will identify association oflipid and lipid mediators with selected MRI markers of dementia previously reported. In Aim 3, we will test howmetabolic pathways linked to dementia differ by race and sex and how these metabolite signatures are relatedto diet, fitness, activity, and adiposity, key modifiable lifestyle features linked to improved neurocognitive func-tion. This supplement is unique in that it has been conceived and constructed in full collaboration with the Na-tional Institutes of Aging (Dr. Luigi Ferrucci and Qu Tian), experts in aging and AD and substantially augmentsthe sample size for metabolite profiling covered by the parent R01 grant, while leveraging its substantial re-sources.

Data from Johns Hopkins Universitysuggest that Hawaii has one of the lowest COVID-19 infection rates in the United States (U.S.) with only 36confirmed coronavirus cases per 100,000 persons (as of mid-April 2020). This was much lower than the U.S.national rate of 177 infections per 100,000 persons ? both of which are hypothesized to be vastlyunderestimated, primarily due to high numbers of undiagnosed infections. One approach to help resolve thesechallenges is to test populations for COVID-19 antibodies (Ab). Early results from such studies in the U.S.mainland, Germany, and Holland, have found that 2% to 30% of populations have previously been infectedwith this coronavirus.We propose to help address these issues by sampling an underrepresented population of older Asian-Americans in Hawaii that have been well studied for other outcomes of interest (e.g. health habits,comorbidities, genetics, etc.) using a reliable Ab test that has FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) and thehighest sensitivity and specificity.We propose the following Specific Aims:Primary Aim: Test the hypothesis that the prevalence rate of prior COVID-19 infection in middle-agedand elderly persons in the Japanese-American community in Hawaii will be higher than reportedprevalence rates. Since the majority of persons in Hawaii tested for COVID-19 infections thus far have beensymptomatic persons, we hypothesize that the actual prevalence rates of prior virus infection within thiscommunity are much higher than official reports from the Hawaii Department of Health (Hawaii Department ofHealth est. 36 cases per 100,000 persons in mid-April 2020). Our study sample will be drawn from a stratifiedrandom sample of over 2,000 previously recruited Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program Offspring Study (KuakiniHHP Offspring Study) participants (n=1,200; age range = 50-90 years).Exploratory Aim #1: Test the hypothesis that those with SARS-CoV-2 Ab+ (positive) tests, and whopossess the longevity-associated FOXO3 and ACE-2 (anti-inflammatory) genotypes, will haveexperienced less severe COVID-19 related-illness (e.g. fewer overall symptoms, fewerpulmonary\\/cardiovascular symptoms, fewer hospitalizations, shorter duration of illness, etc.) thanthose with the common genotype. These study participants will be drawn from the Kuakini HHP OffspringStudy cohort who test Ab positive (est. at 2%-30% of sample, i.e. 32-480 persons). Ab+ participants will beasked to complete a questionnaire detailing severity of symptoms and stratified by FOXO3 genotype.Exploratory Aim #2: Test the hypothesis that the longevity associated FOXO3 genotype and protectiveACE-2 genotype will correlate with lower risk for COVID-19 infection i.e. fewer FOXO3\\/ACE-2 protectiveallele carriers will test positive for SARS-CoV-2 Ab. We hypothesize that those with the FOXO3\\/ACE-2longevity-associated genotypes will be protected from COVID-19 infection.--PROJECT NARRATIVEThis administrative supplement to the 5R01AG027060-10 - FOXO3 Genotype; InflammAging; CardiovascularDisease; and Dementia. Kuakini Hawaii Lifespan Study III will enable the conducting of the first prevalencestudy of COVID-19 in the older Japanese-American community in Hawaii; the largest in the United States. Itmay also provide information for risk stratification for illness severity based on genotype. This informationprovides important insights to help understand how to protect vulnerable minority communities against COVID-19 infection.\"},{\"abstract\":\"ABSTRACTClinical trials are often conducted under idealized and rigorously controlled conditions to ensure internalvalidity, but such conditions, paradoxically, compromise trials external validity (i.e., generalizability to the targetpopulation). Low trial generalizability has long been a concern and widely documented across different clinicalareas. For instance, participants of Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials are systematically younger than ADpatients in the general population. Overly restrictive eligibility criteria are arguably the biggest yet modifiablebarriers causing low generalizability. The FDA has launched numerous initiatives, primarily throughbroadening eligibility criteria, to promote enrollment practices so that trial participants can better reflect thepopulation who would most likely use the treatment if approved. Nevertheless, trial sponsors and investigatorsare reluctant to broaden eligibility criteria due to concerns over potential increases in risk of serious adverseevents (SAEs) and its negative impact on the investigational drug?s safety and effectiveness profile. As aresult, many elderly patients are excluded from AD trials either explicitly through an age restriction or implicitlythrough excluding clinical characteristics more prevalent in the elderly. There is a gap between the need tobroaden trial criteria and ways available to fulfill the need in practice. Previous studies, including ours, havevalidated and used the Generalizability Index of Study Traits (GIST), the best available quantitative, eligibility-driven, a priori generalizability measure, in a number of disease domains. GIST scores can potentially be usedto guide adjustments to criteria towards better population representativeness. However, there are key barriersfor its adoption in practice, especially in AD trials: (1) the lack of a standardized, computable eligibility criteria(CEC) framework to translate criteria to data queries ? a necessary step to define the populations forgeneralizability assessment, and (2) the need to map the mathematical relationships between eligibility criteriaand GIST as well as patient outcomes (i.e. SAE), which answers the critical question how broadened criteriawill affect AD trial?s generalizability and patient outcomes simultaneously. To remove these barriers, wepropose to systematically analyze existing AD trials in ClinicalTrials.gov to create a standardized library of CECfor AD trials and develop statistical models on how adjustments to eligibility criteria, especially age, wouldaffect (1) trial generalizability measured by GIST, and (2) outcomes (i.e., SAEs) of the target population,approximated using real-world data (RWD) from the OneFlorida network. OneFlorida contains linkedelectronic health record (EHR), claims, and cancer registries data for ~15 million Floridians. This study willprovide the necessary data to support future development of a trial eligibility criteria design tool that canoptimize trial generalizability while balancing potential increases in risk of SAEs in the target population.--PROJECT NARRATIVELow trial generalizability has long been a concern and widely documented across different clinical areas;including in Alzheimer's disease (AD) trials. The regulatory agencies such as the FDA and the researchcommunities have called to broaden eligibility criteria towards better clinical trial generalizability so that trialparticipants can better reflect the target population. Our study will generate real-world evidence to support ADtrial design by identifying overly restrictive eligibility criteria and the boundary conditions for broadening thesecriteria towards better study generalizability while balancing potential increases in risk of adverse events in thetarget population.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACTInability to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) is a primary cause of reduced quality of life for the millionsof Americans living with AD\\/ADRD and is an important barrier to living independently for these olderAmericans. Older adults with AD\\/ADRD are at particular risk of functional decline and death followinghospitalization. Sarcopenia, or aging-related declines in skeletal muscle mass and strength is likely to be animportant risk factor for hospital-associated ADL disability in older adults, and this relationship may beparticularly relevant in older adults with AD\\/ADRD. A key barrier to understanding of the contribution ofsarcopenia to the development of hospital-associated ADL disability among those with AD\\/ADRD, is the needfor measures of muscle mass that are feasible in these patients in the acute care setting. Bedside portableultrasound-based measures of thigh muscle architecture are reliable and practical, correlate well with thighmuscle strength in acutely-ill patients, and are already being successfully applied by my group to assess rectusfemoris cross-sectional area (RFCSA) in older adults hospitalized with sepsis.

Older adults hospitalized for specific illnesses, such aspneumonia and sepsis, are particularly at risk for developing new physical disability. During the COVID-19pandemic, older adults, compared to younger adults, are also at greater risk of developing more severeCOVID-19, including greater risk of needing to be hospitalized, of requiring ICU admission, and of developingpneumonia and sepsis. As of May 6, 2020, over 3.7 million individuals throughout the world have developedCOVID-19, of which over 258,000 have died. Given the historic scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, theincreased burden of physical disability associated with COVID-19 is very likely to have a vast public healthimpact, particularly among older adults and those with AD\\/ADRD. However, little is known about the functionaloutcomes of COVID-19, especially among older adults and those with AD\\/ADRD who are most likely to beadversely affected. Addressing this key knowledge gap is critical in identifying key clinical risk factors foradverse outcomes, informing understanding of pathogenesis of physical disability after COVID-19, andultimately developing interventions to prevent or rehabilitate physical disability in these patients.

Monitoring COVID-19 infections in LTCs remains aparticular challenging. The existing and a continued expected shortage of sufficientmolecular COVID-19 testing coupled to false negative rates as high as 15% necessitatesa critical need for new and complementary technologies that can surveil, alert, and trackCOVID-19 infections in this population. Our group are pioneers in the development ofnovel soft electronics. Our recent publication, supported by our active Phase I STTR,was published in Nature Biomedical Engineering detailing a next generation ultra-lowprofile, soft, and flexible sensor (ADAM) that continuously measures subtle acousto-mechanic signals generated by the body via an embedded high-frequency, 3-axisaccelerometer in direct mechanical communication with the skin. The ADAM sensorcommunicates via Bluetooth with our custom mobile application for real time streamingas well as on sensor data storage enabling stand-alone operation. All data streams arecloud synchronized (HIPAA compliant). The highly novel soft, flexible nature allows forthe ADAM sensor to be mountable on unusual locations of high information density.Specifically, we exploit the SN?the only location on the body where there is nodampening effect at the skin level with the intrathoracic cavity. This enables a SN-mounted ADAM sensor to capture heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), temperature,physical activity (PA), swallow count, and talk time, along with additional novelrespiratory biomarkers relevant to COVID-19. In this proposal, we propose to develop anew COVID-19 software package, machine learning enhancements to our coughalgorithm, and validation in LTCs with both elderly patients and staff to evaluateusability, feasibility, and adherence. The high level of technology readiness with partnerLTCs allows us to deploy efficiently to generate essential data for a future FDAEmergency Use Authorization.

Thegoal will be achieved by linking the data of ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to PreventHeart Attack Trial) participants with their Medicare data up to 2017, making the total follow-up time up to 23 years(including 8-year in-trial and 15-year post-trial follow-up). Antihypertensive drug therapies have recently beenassociated with a lower risk of developing dementia and early cognitive impairment. For example, in 2019 theSystolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) Memory and Cognition in Decreased Hypertension (MIND)study reported that intensive blood pressure (BP) control significantly reduced the risk of mild cognitiveimpairment. This was the first trial to demonstrate an effective strategy for the prevention of age-related cognitiveimpairment. Given a high prevalence of hypertension in adult population, adequate utilization of disease-modifying drugs may provide an effective strategy for prevention of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and relateddementias (ADRD). However, there is no large and long-term follow-up study monitoring and assessing theeffects of antihypertensive medications on the risk of ADRD. Therefore, with the detailed blood pressure controldata available during the trial follow-up in ALLHAT participants and with the data of those participants linked withtheir Medicare Part-D drug data up to 2017, we will be able to determine whether blood pressure control andantihypertensive drugs are associated with the decreased risk of ADRD during the 23 years of follow-up from1994 to 2017. We will address the following specific aims in this Alzheimers-focused Administrative Supplement:1) to determine the risk of ADRD in association with blood pressure control and antihypertensive treatments(diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers) in ALLHAT participants; and 2) to examine whetherand to what extent the post-trial antihypertensive medication usage from Medicare Part-D data affect the risk ofADRD in ALLHAT participants with 3 trial treatment arms (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channelblockers), while taking into consideration death as a competing risk and adjusting for comorbid conditions andother confounders.--Project Narrative\\/Public Health RelevanceThe goal of this Alzheimer?s-focused Administrative Supplement will determine whether blood pressure controland antihypertensive drugs from Medicare Part-D comprehensive drug coverage data are associated with thedecreased risk of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) during a long follow-up of up to 23years from 1994 to 2017 in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial(ALLHAT) participants.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary\\/AbstractAlmost two-thirds of Americans with Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias (AD\\/ADRD) are women. Theunderlying mechanisms are unknown but may be associated with a higher prevalence of hypertension and lowerblood pressure (BP) control rate in older women than older men. Indeed, recent research implicates risk factorssuch as hypertension and cerebrovascular dysfunction in the pathogenesis of AD. Cerebrovascular function andcognition can be affected by BP dysregulation via the baroreflex, and baroreflex sensitivity is reduced inhypertension and AD - an effect that is likely related to cerebrovascular dysfunction and arterial stiffening. Thus,decreasing BP, increasing baroreflex sensitivity, and improving cerebrovascular health may be an importantpreventive strategy for AD\\/ADRD in older women with hypertension. One non-drug approach that offers promiseis ?heat therapy?. The objective of this administrative supplement is to leverage our existing clinical trial in orderto perform a proof-of-concept investigation to examine the effects of home-based lower leg heat therapy onAD\\/ADRD risk, as reflected by changes in cerebrovascular function in older hypertensive women. To accomplishthis objective, we will enroll hypertensive women aged 65-79 and randomly assign them to either an interventiongroup or a control group. Patients in the intervention group will perform 8 weeks of home-based lower leg heattherapy via water immersion up to the knee in a circulated bath (water temperature 42\\u00c2\\u00b0C, 4 times per week, 45min per session), whereas patients in the control group will immerse their legs in a thermoneutral water bath(33\\u00c2\\u00b0C) at the same frequency and duration. All patients will also receive a fixed dose of chlorthalidone. Aim 1will examine the effect of heat therapy on cerebral hemodynamics in older hypertensive women. We will usetranscranial Doppler to assess cerebral hemodynamics before and after heat therapy or control treatment.Dynamic cerebral autoregulation will be evaluated by transfer function analysis. Aim 2 will examine themechanisms by which heat therapy impacts cerebral hemodynamics. We will measure ambulatory BP,sympathetic and cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivities, and dynamic arterial compliance, ?-stiffness index and wallthickness of the carotid artery. The associations among cerebral hemodynamics, BP, baroreflex sensitivity, andthe carotid artery properties will be investigated. Aim 3 (exploratory) will examine the effects of heat therapy oncognition and blood-based biomarkers of AD pathology and neurodegeneration in older hypertensive women.We will use the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery to assess cognitive function.
