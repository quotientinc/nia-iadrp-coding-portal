For persons with dementia, disruptive behaviors are a sign of distress and suffering. For caregivers, disruptive behaviors increase stress, caregiver burnout and risk of injury. Unfortunately, our current understanding of disruptive behaviors is limited. Since 1) disruptive behaviors are often triggered by pain and discomfort and 2) persons with Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease and related dementias often have numerous comorbidities which can cause pain and discomfort, we propose to focus on diabetes as a model comorbidity to examine whether diabetes (e.g episodes of hyperglycemia) or diabetes treatments (e.g. fingerstick glucose measurements) are associated with disruptive behaviors in nursing home (NH) residents with dementia.  The overarching goal of the UCSF Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) is to prevent late-life disability when possible, and to improve the quality of life of older people with disability when prevention is not possible (amelioration). The proposed administrative supplement extends this goal specifically to vulnerable older adults residing in NHs who have Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease and related dementias. This proposal fits within the conceptual framework that guides the UCSF OAIC, which holds that care for elders with disability and dementia must consider the wider medical and social context. We will leverage the expertise of the OAIC Data Analysis Core and the Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic health records including laboratory results and medication administration data with Minimum Data Set (MDS) data on disruptive behaviors.  Our proposal will determine whether diabetes (including episodes of hypo- or hyper- glycemia) or diabetes treatments (including frequency of fingerstick measurements or insulin injections) are associated with disruptive behaviors (resistance to care, aggressive physical behaviors and aggressive verbal behaviors). In Aim 1, we propose to determine the prevalence of different types of disruptive behaviors by diabetes status in VA NH residents with Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease and related dementias. In Aim 2a, we will determine the association between diabetes treatments (fingersticks, insulin injections) and disruptive behaviors. In Aim 2b, we will determine the association between episodes of hypo- and hyper- glycemia with disruptive behaviors. Results from the proposed studies would provide critical preliminary data to support compelling NIA ADRD R01 applications focusing on disruptive behaviors and comorbidities in generalizable NH populations with dementia as well as intervention studies on whether modifying the care of comorbidities can decrease disruptive behaviors.

Since persons with ADRD frequently have many comorbidities, it is important to examine how those comorbidities and their treatments affect disruptive behaviors. This administrative supplement will focus on diabetes as a model condition to determine associations between diabetes, diabetes treatments, and disruptive behaviors in Veterans Affairs nursing home residents with ADRD.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY Cirrhosis is characterized by a spectrum of neurocognitive impairments that is often diagnosed as a single cirrhosis-specific entity, \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c5\\u0093hepatic encephalopathy\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d, and considered fully reversible with liver transplantation. But while overt mental status changes often improve within days of transplant, our preliminary data revealed that 18% of liver transplant recipients displayed at least mild cognitive impairment, a precursor for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), at 6 months after transplant, despite normal liver function and an average age of only 58 years. This raises the possibility that some cognitive impairments in cirrhosis are, in fact, not reversible, and potentially represent undiagnosed ADRD and\\/or elevated risk for ADRD. But at the current time, the prevalence of ADRD in liver transplant patients is neither known nor have the factors contributing to ADRD risk in this population been identified, precluding discussions about risks of post- transplant ADRD and development of risk-reducing interventions. Liver transplant patients have multiple risk factors that increase their risk for ADRD, including contributions from underlying chronic liver disease, high rates of ADRD-related co-morbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), and low education level. Risk for ADRD is further exacerbated after transplant by high rates of delirium and use of long-term immunosuppression. Lastly, frailty, a state that is associated with incident ADRD and shares common biological pathways with ADRD, is highly prevalent in cirrhosis and persists long after transplant. Together, these high-risk factors offer scientific premise for our hypothesis that liver transplant patients have a high prevalence of and risk for ADRD. The overarching goal of our parent R01AG059183 is to investigate the impact of liver transplantation on global functional health as defined by classical geriatric constructs such as physical frailty and disability. The proposed administrative supplement expands this goal by broadening our definition of global functional health from physical to cognitive function, with the intent to identify those with or at risk for ADRD. To accomplish this, we propose a 2-step process involving initial screening\\/detection followed by ADRD evaluation\\/diagnosis by a specialist (as recommended by the NIA AD Diagnostic Guidelines). Specifically, using our robust, multi-center research infrastructure, we aim to: 1) characterize the prevalence of and identify clinical predictors of cognitive impairment after liver transplantation using the novel, efficient Brain Health Assessment in a diverse cohort of 350 liver transplant recipients \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b0\\u00c2\\u00a560 years old (since age is a strong ADRD risk factor) across the 5 sites, and 2) conduct detailed cognitive phenotyping (with comprehensive neurologic testing and neuroimaging) in a subset of 15 individuals with cognitive impairment to establish a clinical diagnosis of ADRD and etiologic factors contributing to cognitive impairment. IMPACT: This study will establish a cohort liver transplant recipients with baseline cognitive assessments as the platform for future proposals to investigate longitudinal changes in cognitive function, progression to ADRD, and modifiable ADRD risk factors in this high risk population. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE Liver transplant patients have multiple risk factors for early or accelerated development of Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD), including high rates of ADRD-related co-morbidities, low education level, post- transplant delirium, long-term immunosuppression, and long-standing frailty. But at the current time, the prevalence of ADRD in liver transplant patients is neither known nor have the factors contributing to ADRD risk in this population been identified, precluding discussions about risks of post-transplant ADRD and development of risk-reducing interventions. This proposal aims to characterize the prevalence of and identify clinical predictors of cognitive impairment, a key precursor for ADRD, in a large, diverse cohort of liver transplant recipients, and to conduct deep cognitive phenotyping in a small subset to establish a clinical diagnosis of ADRD; together, these cohorts will serve as the foundation for future investigation of longitudinal changes in cognitive function, progression to ADRD, and modifiable ADRD risk factors in this population at high risk for ADRD.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY \\/ ABSTRACT Depression has an enormous impact: it is the leading cause of disability worldwide and affects more than 264 million people of all ages. Moreover, major depression at any age doubles the risk of Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease and related dementias, which affect over 50 million people worldwide \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d a number projected to triple by 2050. Interventions for depression in older adults have limited efficacy to date, and directly treating cognitive impairment and\\/or Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease is not feasible or effective. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors that favorably influence both depression and cognition before dementia onset is an urgent public health need. Sleep is one such risk factor. However, sleep is not a uni-dimensional construct represented by merely its duration or the presence\\/absence of a sleep disorder. Rather sleep is multidimensional: it is comprised of multiple domains (e.g., Regularity, Satisfaction, Sleepiness, Timing, Efficiency, Duration) and measured on multiple levels (e.g. self-report or behavioral [via actigraphy]). In our initial R01, we leveraged our biostatistical and sleep expertise to develop and hone methods for examining multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of mortality in a high- dimensional machine learning (ML) context that flexibly accounts for the complex interactions that exist among sleep and non-sleep risk factors. We now seek to build on the success of the initial funding period by using our novel methods to examine multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of changes in cognition and depressive symptoms. To enhance generalizability and power, we are developing a Pooled Sample of N~3,400 adults aged \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b0\\u00c2\\u00a565 without cognitive impairment from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study, Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Minority Aging Research Study (MARS). With these methods and data, we will examine multidimensional sleep health for predicting changes in global cognition and incident dementia (Aim 1) and depressive symptoms (Aim 2) in a high-dimensional machine learning context. We will also examine depression as a pathway through which multidimensional sleep health predicts impaired cognition (Aim 3). Our Secondary Aims are to: (a) apply parallel methods in two additional cohorts (the Rotterdam Study and Multi- Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) to replicate and extend our findings to cohorts with different demographic profiles and clinical Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease and related dementias diagnoses; (b) examine effects by sex and race; and (c) identify the sleep health characteristics driving overall effects. Identifying multidimensional sleep health profiles that reliably predict changes in global cognition, incident dementia, and changes in depressive symptoms in a realistic, high dimensional context will directly inform the design of novel targeted interventions and prospective studies focused on preventing Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease and related dementias. Moreover, we will amplify the impact of our work by demonstrating new methods for studying health and depositing harmonized data on the National Sleep Research Resource to facilitate future multi-cohort secondary analyses. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression and Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease and Related Dementias are among the leading contributors to morbidity, disability, and mortality worldwide. This project will apply novel machine learning techniques to large multi-cohort samples to determine whether multidimensional sleep health predicts cognitive outcomes (change in cognition, incident dementia; Aim 1) and change in depressive symptoms (Aim 2), and examine depressive symptoms as a pathway through which multidimensional sleep health predicts cognitive outcomes. Through our multi-cohort secondary data analysis approach, which offers enhanced generalizability and power and an efficient use of existing resources, our findings will directly inform the design of subsequent prospective studies aimed at developing integrated approaches to treating depression and cognitive decline in older adults, with implications for preventing Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease and Related Dementias.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Abstract. It has become increasingly clear that the cerebrovascular system is under assault in many individuals infected with COVID-19. In recent studies, patients with hypertension were found at a two-fold increased risk of dying from COVID-19 infection, and 100% of infected patients who received a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam showed reduced CBF with 23% showing evidence indicative of ischemic stroke. The cerebrovascular dysregulation due to COVID-19 may add to the already enormous burden of stroke and dementia associated with age-related vascular deterioration. The pathogen SARS-CoV-2, causing COVID-19 illness, is now known to reduce function of an enzyme termed ACE2 that is a major regulator in the Renin- Angiotensin system (RAS) that controls blood pressure and cerebral blood flow (CBF). This SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology might lead to excessive stimulation of type 1 angiotensin receptor (AT1R) but reduced stimulation of type 2 angiotensin receptor (AT2R), which is likely to both exacerbate hypertension and disrupt CBF autoregulation and neurovascular coupling. Fortunately, two classes of currently available antihypertensive medications are designed to regulate RAS by inhibiting AT1R. However, there may be a critical difference between these two classes. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are protective of the pro-CBF activity on the AT2R, and thus may be more effective at preventing the cerebrovascular dysregulation than the other class, inhibitors of an enzyme termed ACE (ACEIs), which inhibit AT2R activity. The goal of this R21 research proposal is to compare the effectiveness of ARB and ACEI antihypertensive medicines in preventing long-term cerebrovascular dysregulation in hypertensive patients infected with COVID- 19. Two novel imaging methods recently developed in our lab will be leveraged to assess CBF autoregulation and neurovascular coupling (NVC) at least 1 year after the severe infection. First, we will conduct noninvasive optimized arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI and respiratory challenge-weighted blood oxygenation level- dependent (BOLD) MRI to measure baseline CBF and autoregulatory capacity in combination with novel analyses that decouple the magnitude of vascular signal from contamination due to timing-related differences. Second, we will acquire simultaneous resting-state electroencephalogram and BOLD MRI to estimate the body\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s capacity to adjust vascular energy delivery in response to changes in the demand from neural electrophysiological activity. We will quantify this NVC with cutting-edge mathematical analysis that detects transient states of network activity in EEG and models the time-concordant local BOLD MRI responses. Successful implementation of this approach would offer sensitive measurement of CBF regulation in hypertensive COVID-19 survivors and would indicate that one class of antihypertensive medication may be more effective in CBF management in the face of COVID-19-related dysregulation, demonstrating urgency of clinical trials of RAS inhibitors in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 to optimize future clinical care. -- Project narrative Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that challenged health care systems in unprecedented ways, questioning whether established treatment routines for common diseases, such hypertension or diabetes, must be amended to ensure optimal management in the \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c5\\u0093new normal\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d conditions. Two classes of antihypertensive medicines, termed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), may have critical differences in how they interact with the effects of the COVID-19 pathogen on the cerebrovascular system. We propose here to conduct cutting edge brain imaging through the implementation of innovative combined arterial spin labeling, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and electroencephalography procedures to compare the effectiveness of these medicine classes in preventing long-term cerebrovascular dysfunction in hypertensive patients who contracted COVID-19.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY \\/ ABSTRACT Genomics has become an increasingly important aspect of large clinical trials and cohort studies. Genomic data is an essential component for investigating of the joint contribution of environmental and inherited factors on health and disease during ageing. However, the value of genomic information can rarely be achieved by the analysis of data from a single cohort. Rather, data from multiple cohorts must be combined together into a consortium, to achieve statistical power required for novel gene discovery. Many of prominent genomics consortia involve contribution of genomic data from many different NIH-funded cohorts, for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses. Examples include the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), and the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). Our study, the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial - and subsequent observational extension study (ASPREE-XT) - have been fortunate to have collected biospecimens via the ASPREE Healthy Ageing Biobank and generated genomic data on a majority of participants (~15,000 healthy older individuals with targeted sequencing and genome-wide SNP data). This information is of now significant value to in the work of our U19 AG062682 in determining the relative and joint impact of lifestyle, genomics and environmental influences on health in an older population. The availability of the genomic datasets also has presented recent opportunities and imperatives for ASPREE-XT to enter genomics consortia, to contribute to gene discovery efforts. The large size and high quality of ASPREE-XT data will make the study a particularly important (& often dominant) component of these consortia. Yet the current resources within ASPREE-XT to participate in a leadership role in these collaborative ventures is limited. Given the significance of the ASPREE-XT contribution, it requires ASPREE-XT investigators taking leadership roles in these consortia \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009c including in the analysis of consortia data and leading publications. Making this type of contribution is proving increasingly complex and time consuming, given the ongoing efforts required in each consortium to attend working groups, contribute intellectually, participate in analyses, papers etc. In this administrative supplement, we are requesting supplemental funding to enable ASPREE-XT investigators to participate fully in these genomics consortia, with a focus on those related to Alzheimer's Dementia, and contribute to scientific outputs. This would improve the exposure and profile of the ASPREE-XT study, and elevate the overall impact and prominence of the ASPREE-XT research program, especially in the area of dementia and Alzheimer's disease genetics, where considerable opportunities exist for ASPREE-XT to make meaningful contributions. The consortia opportunities have mostly emerged only recently (within the past 6-12 months), highlighting the need to build new capacity in this area of genomics for the study, to capitalize on these new opportunities in a timely fashion. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiological cohort studies, such as the ASPREE-XT study, seek to investigate the relative and joint impact of lifestyle, genomics and environmental influences on health. However, to achieve sufficient statistical power for gene discovery and address knowledge gaps in human genomics - often a consortium combining data from multiple different studies is required. In this supplement, we propose to build the foundation required for enabling ASPREE-XT to take a leadership role in several prominent genomics consortia spanning a range of different disease areas, especially in Alzheimer's disease and dementia genetics.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a syndrome that affects up to 84% of hospitalized older adults with Alzheimer's disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), and is associated with malnutrition, dehydration, aspiration events, pneumonia, increased mortality, longer hospital stay, and higher costs. In the hospital setting, where OD is often exacerbated by the acute illness and hospital environment, standard of care entails withholding all oral intake (nil per os, NPO) and dysphagia diets (texture modified food and thickened liquids). Yet, there is insufficient evidence for the clinical benefit of these dietary restrictions. Furthermore, dietary restrictions lead to decreased oral intake and dehydration, which may further exacerbate OD and lead to delirium, respiratory complications, decreased quality of life, and mortality. Therefore, it is critical for us to examine the standard of care assumption that dietary restrictions result in improved clinical outcomes. The overarching aim of this study is to use an existing data set of hospitalized persons with ADRD to evaluate the relationship between dietary restrictions (standard care) and adverse clinical outcomes in the management of OD, as compared to a non-restricted diet (alternative to standard care). Our hypothesis is that dietary restrictions will be associated with increased adverse hospital outcomes (mortality, respiratory complications, dehydration, length of stay, and readmission) as compared to a non-restricted diet. Our data consists of 35,925 hospitalized persons with ADRD admitted to the medicine service across 11 diverse hospitals between 2017 and 2019. In preliminary work using a subset of this data, we demonstrated high prevalence of dietary restrictions in patients with ADRD. Our multidisciplinary research team is well-positioned to accomplish the following 3 Aims: 1) Determine whether NPO is associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized persons with ADRD and OD, compared to any oral intake (restricted and non-restricted diet); 2) Determine whether a dysphagia diet is associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized persons with ADRD and OD, compared to a non-restricted diet; and 3) Determine whether dietary restrictions (NPO or dysphagia diet) are associated with delirium in hospitalized persons with ADRD and OD, compared to a non-restricted diet. We will use propensity score matching to evaluate associations between dietary restrictions and adverse outcomes. This line of work is significant, because it will examine the current standard of care of OD in hospitalized patients with ADRD. This research is innovative, because it will be the first study to associate dietary restrictions with meaningful clinical outcomes, using a large hospital database of clinically rich variables. The findings from this proposal will be used to support the application for a large-scale clinical trial to prospectively evaluate the effects of dietary restrictions for OD in hospitalized patients with ADRD. Our findings will lay the essential groundwork needed to examine the current standard of care of OD in patients with ADRD and has the potential to improve important clinical outcomes and quality of life for this vulnerable patient population. -- Project Narrative This study will use an existing data set of hospitalized persons with Alzheimer's disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) to evaluate the relationship between dietary restrictions (withholding all oral intake and dysphagia diets) and adverse clinical outcomes in the management of oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD).

Our findings will lay the essential groundwork needed to examine the current standard of care of OD in patients with ADRD and has the potential to improve outcomes and quality of life for this vulnerable patient population.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Abstract: This administrative supplement is submitted in response to Notice Number: NOT-AG-20-034: Alzheimer's Disease Administrative supplements for NIH grants. This supplement outlines experiments to extend the parent U01 (UF PASS: Regulation of exercise transducers) to pursue the interaction between exercise, skeletal muscle health and progression of pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease (AD). The parent award is part of the MoTrPAC consortium that combines well defined exercise interventions with multi-omics analysis to develop a map of molecular transducers that link exercise to systemic health. For this administrative supplement we will use a defined mouse model of AD with a treadmill training protocol based on the protocol used for MoTrPAC. We will also be in a position to analyze our outcomes data in the context of the larger multiomics data available from MoTrPAC to expand our understanding of potential cross tissue interpretations. A major challenge in the field of Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease (AD) is the poor understanding of how tau pathology promotes disease. Consequently, therapeutic interventions are ineffective and clinical trials for AD have failed. The working model for this supplement is that exercise mitigates the onset and progression of AD tau pathology through impacting skeletal muscle health as well as direct effects on the brain. The rationale for this model comes from two complementary but not fully explored sub-fields: \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c5\\u0093AD and muscle\\/sarcopenia\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d and \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c5\\u0093AD and exercise\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d. Several clinical studies have reported that muscle weakness and loss of muscle mass occurs at a faster rate in AD patients. These muscle changes in the patients are also associated with brain atrophy and diminished cognitive performance. In addition, several studies using animal models of AD have demonstrated changes in skeletal muscle metabolism at times prior to the appearance of AD pathology in the brain. These observations are consistent with our preliminary data that found significant muscle weakness in a tauopathy mouse model of AD prior to overt signs of neurodegeneration. There are also a large number of clinical and preclinical studies showing that exercise training, primarily endurance exercise, has a positive impact on the onset and progression of AD. Thus, we propose to integrate the concepts of exercise, muscle health and brain health to define molecules and pathways that attenuate the onset and progression of AD tau pathology in the brain. We propose the following Specific Aims. Aim 1) To determine the molecular, histological and phenotypic changes in skeletal muscle and brain in an acquired tauopathy model of AD in mice. Aim 2) To use a running exercise intervention with the AD-tauopathy mouse model to identify molecular sites through which tau pathology is attenuated. -- Narrative: Research has shown that skeletal muscle pathologies correlate with the progression of pathology in Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease patients. In addition, studies have demonstrated that exercise training provides significant benefits to AD patients.

In this context, Tai Chi has gained the interest of researchers and clinicians because it incorporates physical, cognitive, social, and meditative components within the same activity. Such multimodal exercise modality is expected to have a positive effect on older adults\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2 executive and global cognitive function, including attentional control, planning, response to inhibition, and working memory. Hence, Tai Chi- based interventions could help researchers and clinicians to address cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. In the proposed study, we will recruit a small cohort of older adults, 65-85 years of age, with mild cognitive impairments, and ask them to participate in a 12-week home-based Tai Chi program. The study will rely on a tele-health system that our team recently developed as part of the parent award (#R42AG059491). Subjects will be evaluated pre- and post-intervention using a battery of tests chosen to assess the impact of the intervention on executive and global cognitive function, physical function, and quality of life. This battery of tests will include, as primary outcome measures, the Trail Making Test (to assess the impact of the tele-Tai Chi intervention on cognitive function) and the Dual task Stride Time Variability (DSTV) test (to assess the impact of the tele-Tai Chi intervention on combined physical and cognitive function). In addition, this battery of tests will include, as secondary outcome measures, standard assessments of physical function such as the Timed Up-and-Go test, handgrip strength, the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, and the Activities Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) questionnaire. Health-related quality-of-life will be assessed using the SF-12. Depressive symptoms will be assessed with the Center of Epidemiology Studies-Depression Scale Revised. Self-reported functional capacity will be assessed with the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. These data will be compared pre- vs. post-intervention to derive effect size estimates and power a future, larger scale study. -- Project Narrative There is a growing interest for the development and assessment of exercise-based interventions to slow the progression of age-related cognitive decline and dementia. Recent literature suggests that Tai Chi provides an exercise modality that is particularly suitable to preserve and restore executive function, including important cognitive skills such as attentional control, planning, response to inhibition, and working memory. The proposed pilot study is meant to provide a preliminary assessment of the effects on older adults with mild cognitive impairments of a Tai Chi-based exercise program delivered in the home setting using a tele-health system.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability around the world and disproportionately affects older adults. After a stroke, older adults commonly exhibit gait dysfunction (e.g., slow, unstable, asymmetric walking), which is the top patient-reported rehabilitation target. In addition to motor deficits, approximately 70% of people living with chronic stroke also have post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). While post-stroke gait rehabilitation interventions effectively mitigate gait dysfunction in aging adults, there remains a significant degree of inter- individual variability in walking outcomes. We posit this is because current gait rehabilitation interventions are predominantly structured to leverage explicit versus implicit locomotor learning. Importantly, explicit motor learning is cognitively demanding. It occurs through intentional changes to a movement based on external feedback and relies primarily on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Whereas, implicit motor learning is cerebellum-dependent and occurs more automatically in response to proprioceptive feedback. Despite evidence of shared neural resources between cognitive and motor processing, the impact of PSCI on the capacity for these forms of motor learning during walking remains largely unexplored. The overall goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that PSCI moderates explicit, but not implicit, locomotor learning in older adults with chronic stroke and identify the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in this relationship. Under this career development award, the PI (Leech) will develop skills in neuropsychology, structural neuroimaging, and advanced statistics. This training will promote the achievement of her long-term career goal: as an independent investigator, to develop effective, comprehensive, individualized interventions to reduce disability in older adults. This project has three research aims. Aim 1 will determine the impact of PSCI severity on explicit locomotor learning in older adults post-stroke. Aim 2 will test the impact of the PSCI severity the capacity for implicit locomotor learning in the same group of participants. Finally, Aim 3 will examine the role of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex structural integrity in explicit locomotor learning post-stroke. Older adults with chronic stroke who have a range of PSCI severity will complete the procedures necessary for all three aims over a total of 2 experimental sessions. We expect to show that PSCI severity limits an individual\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s capacity to learn a more symmetric walking pattern through explicit, but not implicit, locomotor learning and that this relationship will be mediated by the structural integrity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This work will provide necessary scientific foundation for a program of research to develop an individualized gait rehabilitation intervention anchored to cognitive impairment and a comprehensive predictive model of locomotor learning in older adults post-stroke. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to determine how post-stroke cognitive impairment moderates motor learning during walking in older adults with chronic stroke and identify brain structural markers that mediate this relationship. The chosen experimental design integrates biomechanical analyses, neuropsychological assessments, and brain imaging techniques to determine the impact of post-stroke cognitive impairment severity on two forms of motor learning (explicit and implicit) and examine the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the relationship between cognition and explicit motor learning. Ultimately, this work may lead to the development of a more comprehensive, effective treatment approach to improve walking dysfunction in older adults post-stroke.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Abstract: The purpose of this Research Supplement is to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research through support of the career development training for Bryan Alava, a current PhD student at the University of Florida.

The primary objectives of Mr. Alava\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s proposed research are two-fold: First to use a defined Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease (AD) mouse model to characterize changes in skeletal muscle function and blood markers of inflammation and metabolism. Second, once characterized we will use this model to test a treadmill training protocol, based on the protocol used for MoTrPAC, for efficacy in delaying the progression of AD. We will also be in a position to access the larger multiomics data available from MoTrPAC to expand potential molecular targets of exercise and AD pathology. Dr. Esser, the PI of the U01, will be one of two primary mentors for Mr. Alava. Dr. Jose Abisambra is the other co-mentor as his lab provides the AD mouse model and expertise in the analysis of brain pathologies. Drs. Esser and Abisambra are already official co-mentors for Bryan Alava within the Ph.D. program in the Department of Physiology and Functional Genomics within the College of Medicine at the University of Florida. We have outlined a series of didactic and experiential training activities that will equip Mr. Alava with the necessary skills to progress as an independent scientist and to fulfill the NIH mission to advance the careers of a diverse population of scientists. -- Narrative: The purpose of this application is to provide support for the career development training of Bryan Alava, a current PhD student at the University of Florida. This administrative supplement will facilitate career development for the candidate and as well as contribute to the mission of the parent project - to discover novel exercise induced health related outcomes.\"},{\"abstract\":\"ABSTRACT Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease and Related Dementias (PwADRD). Fall costs are expected to reach $67.7 billion this year and add to family caregiver (CG) burden. Injurious falls are a frequent reason people are unable to remain at home, resulting in significantly increased care costs to the family and society.

Deprescribing is the process of reducing or stopping inappropriate medications or medications unlikely to be beneficial supervised by a health-care professional. Patients, caregivers for people with ADRD, and clinicians list potential adverse drug withdrawal events (ADWE) following medication discontinuation as a key barrier to deprescribing. ADWE are not well reported by deprescribing trials, and no large-scale interventions have reported prevalence or predictors of ADWE. Further, ADWE presenting in ambulatory care are rarely captured. This lack of evidence is largely due to inadequate methods for measuring ADWE: Identifying and measuring ADWE requires knowing the timing of medication discontinuation and understanding whether subsequent symptoms or diagnoses constitute ADWE. Our experience with safety monitoring for the OPTMIZE intervention of deprescribing education in ADRD (R33AG057289, MPIs Bayliss \\/ Boyd), a pragmatic, cluster randomized trial to increase deprescribing awareness among patients with ADRD, their family, and primary care clinicians, has exemplified these methodologic gaps and provided the impetus for the proposed work. The project will leverage knowledge and methods from safety monitoring for the ADRD population in OPTIMIZE, combined with rich longitudinal clinical and pharmacy data from the Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) EHR and Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW) to develop and test methods to generate robust evidence on deprescribing safety. Our study populations will be older adults with MCC and the OPTIMIZE population with dementia plus MCC. Aim 1 will identify individuals who experience medication discontinuation and subsequent ADWE using record review and adjudication. Aim 2 will develop and validate a text mining tool to identify medication discontinuation applicable to multiple classes of medications. Aim 3 will apply the text mining tool in combination with common ADWE diagnoses in two separate cohorts to demonstrate a data-based approach to identifying medication discontinuation and possible ADWE: a sample of older adults with MCC and the OPTIMIZE population of individuals with dementia plus MCC. Aim 4 will model patient and clinical factors predictive of ADWE in the ADRD and MCC populations. Generating adequate evidence to support safe and effective deprescribing for ADRD and MCC populations requires new data-based methods and approaches. -- Project Narrative Patient-centered care should include medical treatment to achieve goals of care, but not medicines that are either likely to be harmful or unhelpful. Deprescribing is the process of reducing or stopping the use of inappropriate medications or medications unlikely to be beneficial supervised by a health-care professional. We will develop and test a novel tool and methods to generate adequate safety evidence to support thoughtful and effective deprescribing using a new data-based approach.\"},{\"abstract\":\"ABSTRACT: RELEVANCE TO ADRD Only 13% of dialysis patients have normal cognition. Older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are at risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) due to their advanced age, high burden of vascular disease, and comorbid conditions. Dialysis results in rapid fluid shifts that can lead to wide swings in blood pressure, cerebral atrophy, and brain injury; uremic metabolites are not fully cleared and impact cognitive function. Older dialysis patients have a 21-25% risk of a dementia diagnosis and 4-8% risk of an ADRD diagnoses; this is 19-fold and 7-fold higher than community-dwelling older adults without ESRD. Kidney transplantation (KT) is a growing treatment option for older adults with ESRD and improves cognitive function. However, even after careful pre-operative cognitive screening to identify the dialysis patients with existing dementia, post-KT incidence of dementia and ADRD is high. Compared to an ADRD risk of 0.6-0.9% for community-dwelling older adults, we found that 7.2-17.0% of older KT recipients received a diagnosis of ADRD. Yet, only half of patients who would meet diagnostic criteria for dementia receive a diagnosis suggesting that there is a substantial burden of undiagnosed ADRD among dialysis patients and KT recipients. An ADRD diagnosis doubles mortality risk for dialysis patients, and increases the risk of mortality and graft loss for KT recipients. ADRD is a clinical and public health challenge for this population, yet diagnosis of dementia notoriously underestimates the true incidence; <15% of ESRD patients with cognitive impairment have chart documentation. There is a clear knowledge gap surrounding which older ESRD patients will develop ADRD. Older ESRD patients experience a high burden of geriatric-specific risk factors for ADRD including frailty, depressive symptoms, and cognitive impairment. KT eliminates or reduces these ESRD-specific risk factors and improves cognitive function. However, there is a tradeoff: perioperative ADRD risk factors, like delirium and neurotoxic immunosuppression, may impact long-term ADRD risk. We will add novel assessments of ADRD and delirium to our prospective R01-funded study of frailty and aging among older (age\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b0\\u00c2\\u00a555; n=3,000) KT candidates undergoing dialysis and older KT recipients, where global (MoCA) and domain-specific (TMT- A\\/B, AVLT) cognitive performance are already measured. We seek to: 1) To estimate the burden of pre- and post-KT dementia and ADRD among older ESRD patients; 2) To identify geriatric- and ESRD-specific ADRD risk factors among older ESRD patients; and 3) To test whether perioperative factors mediate the pre-KT risk for subsequent post-KT ADRD. Our findings will help clarify the risk factors and burden of ADRD among older ESRD patients. This work will be directly applicable to all older surgical patients who are at risk for perioperative complications like delirium and cognitive decline leading to long-term ADRD. -- ORIGINAL PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Longevity matching for the new kidney allocation system is based on Estimated Post-Transplant Survival (EPTS), a purposefully simple model that only includes chronologic age, diabetes status, time on dialysis, and prior transplant; in this model chronologic age is used a surrogate for physiologic reserve which disadvantages older kidney transplant (KT) candidates. We will 1) develop an ESRD-specific measure of physiologic reserve and test the validity, reliability and generalizability of this novel measure, 2) calculate physiologic age based on the ESRD-specific measure of physiologic reserve, and 3) integrate physiologic age into EPTS, testing whether it improves mortality prognostication for older KT recipients\"},{\"abstract\":\"3 R24 AG065025-02S1, Steinman, Michael A. Medication-related problems are often the cause of emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and transition to higher levels of care in older adults experiencing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease or Related Dementias (ADRD). Medication complexity adds to the caregiver burden and often results in negative health outcomes and diminished quality of life for both, the patient and the caregiver. Nowhere is this problem more real and impactful than in older adults with MCI and ADRD in the underserved, lower socioeconomic, and health disparity populations in rural Appalachian Kentucky. Outreach into such areas to improve healthcare through interventions such as multidisciplinary deprescribing and medication optimization has been further impacted by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Developing novel, remotely delivered, deprescribing and medication optimization strategies to ADRD populations in Appalachia is a primary goal of our efforts. Utilizing our vast and well-established (16 years of operation) rural telemedicine clinic focused on age-related cognitive decline, MCI, and ADRD, we propose to develop and assess the efficacy of remote strategies for medication optimization and healthcare assessment. We will evaluate remote delivery of optimal deprescribing strategies that will serve as a translational bridge between our prior work at the University of Kentucky and service delivery to underserved populations. Such efforts will serve as a model to be further investigated in other health disparate and underserved populations with ADRD nationwide. These efforts are bolstered by our previous experience implementing deprescribing regimens to improve cognitive reserve in participants seen in a tertiary care setting through our NIA funded study (R01AG054130), our adaptation to remote medication therapy management during the time of COVID, our well-established network of engaged rural healthcare practices, as well as our ability to deliver such interventions directly into the homes of those with ADRD living remotely in underserved, health disparate, regions of rural Kentucky Appalachia.  Mobilizing our resources to optimize an immediately implementable strategy for remote outreach in rural ADRD populations using HIPAA-compliant videoconferencing technology, allows for both an immediate direct impact on such interventions in the time of COVID, and will greatly expand the translational reach to health disparity populations that may be geographically distanced from the core centers of the parent grant. Our well-established experience in providing medication optimization interventions to the aging population with cognitive decline of ADRD type has allowed us to develop routine practices of assessment of medication appropriateness, as well as implementation of a multidisciplinary physician-pharmacist team targeting improvement in cognitive outcomes in the aging population. This approach will be carried forward through a telemedicine practice comprised of approximately 500 ADRD patient-caregiver dyads throughout rural areas of Appalachian Kentucky. -- Public Health Relevance Statement The \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c5\\u0093Assessment of Medication Optimization in Rural Kentucky Appalachian patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia: The AMOR\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u00a5Kentucky\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d study will examine the impact of a pharmacist-physician patient-centered medication therapy management deprescribing intervention to address inappropriate medication use in patients with cognitive impairment in underserved, lower socioeconomic populations in rural Appalachian Kentucky.

During the first year of the project, substantial progress has been made towards the original aims. The Network has supported mutual learning and collaboration through a Junior Investigators Intensive and other opportunities, created a coordinated network of research sites, developed and disseminated resources to aid deprescribing research, funded innovative pilot studies and grant planning awards, and engaged stakeholders to maximize the relevance of research on deprescribing.  The goal of this supplement is to expand the work of the Network to focus on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Specifically, the project will address a high-priority area for deprescribing research \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009c the development of a tool for pragmatically identifying family and unpaid caregivers of people living with dementia (PLWD) for deprescribing trials. PLWD face considerable medication-related treatment burden and harms. Caregivers are often responsible for medication management, face strain due to medication-related tasks and have specific informational and decisional needs and conflicts. Purposeful engagement of caregivers is critical for implementing deprescribing for PLWD. Yet, a major gap in the deprescribing knowledge base is that few deprescribing interventions have specifically identified or engaged ADRD caregivers. Moreover, caregivers are not routinely identified or supported in care delivery, and health systems rarely collect data on outcomes that reflect their lived experience. Systematically identifying caregivers with responsibility for managing medications would facilitate pragmatic trial recruitment, tailored delivery of deprescribing interventions to caregivers and collection of caregiver-reported outcome measures. The aims of this supplemental award are: 1) To iteratively refine a tool for identifying caregivers of PLWD for future embedded pragmatic deprescribing trials through a user-centered design process involving in-depth interviews with key stakeholders; and 2) To test the resultant tool with 25 patient-caregiver dyads at two healthcare systems (50 dyads in total) to establish proof of concept, feasibility and acceptability of the process. There is an urgent public health need to build the nation's capacity to conduct pragmatic clinical trials of strategies to improve the care of PLWD and their caregivers, including deprescribing, under \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c5\\u0093real-world\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d conditions.

Older cancer survivors are a rapidly growing population; in the United States there are >10 million cancer survivors aged 65. Older cancer survivors experience long-term side effects from prior therapy, such as Cancer-Related Cognitive Dysfunction (CRCD). CRCD is a prevalent side effect and creates difficulties in memory, attention and executive function. Up to 35% of cancer survivors experience CRCD symptoms months to years after completion of their cancer therapy. Older patients with cancer, particularly those with lower cognitive reserve, are most vulnerable to CRCD. One hypothesis is that CRCD may contribute to cognitive effects in older cancer survivors with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD\\/ADRD.  Prior studies evaluating non-pharmacologic interventions (e.g. Cognitive Training) for older adults with MCI and AD have demonstrated improvement in cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Older cancer survivors with MCI are at risk of progressing to AD, however if CRCD is contributing to cognitive difficulties, this may be a reversible component. Memory and Attention Adaptation Training-Geriatrics (MAAT-G) is a cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention for CRCD. Providing MAAT-G to older cancer survivors with MCI who are at greatest risk for developing AD\\/ADRD may afford improvements in perceived and objective cognitive function by addressing the reversible components of CRCD. MAAT-G is delivered by a clinical psychologist via videoconferencing during a series of ten workshop sessions. As a component of the parent K76 award, MAAT-G was adapted by the PI using the Contextual, Cohort-based, Maturity, Specific Challenge (CCMSC) model; feedback from older cancer survivors guided further adaptation of the intervention. The primary goal of the K76 is to assess the preliminary efficacy of MAAT-G on older adults with cancer actively on treatment. Though in the parent study as currently designed, many of these patients may not meet criteria for MCI. Therefore, the overarching goal of this administrative supplement is to evaluate the feasibility of delivering MAAT-G in 35 older cancer survivors with MCI who have completed cancer therapy by determining consent rate, intervention adherence rate, and study completion rate in this population. We will also examine the change in perceived and objective cognitive function and functional independence following the intervention. Additionally, we will gather perspectives on the feasibility and perceived cognitive benefits of MAAT-G in older cancer survivors with MCI through semi-structured interviews with patients and caregivers of the enrolled patients. If MAAT-G is feasible to deliver in older cancer survivors with MCI, future work would evaluate the benefit of MAAT-G on perceived and objective cognition and functional independence in a randomized clinical trial in this population. -- NARRATIVE Older cancer survivors experience long-term side effects from prior therapy, such as Cancer-Related Cognitive Dysfunction (CRCD), which can create difficulties in memory, attention and executive function in up to 35% of cancer survivors even months to years after completion of their cancer therapy.

In older cancer survivors with MCI, the long-lasting effects of CRCD may be contributing to their cognitive difficulties and the goal of this supplement is to evaluate the feasibility of delivering a CRCD intervention in older cancer survivors with MCI to ultimately determine if this may afford improvements in perceived and objective cognitive function for this population.\"},{\"abstract\":\"SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACT Adults with Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease are at an increased risk of developing pressure injuries (commonly known as pressure ulcers).

Pressure injuries lead to high healthcare costs, further disability, decreased quality of life, pressure injury pain in older adults, and can result in death when sepsis is present. Wheelchair use is responsible for 36% to 50% of pressure injuries, and wheelchair use is common among adults with Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s both living at home or in assisted living facilities.

A key component for the prevention of pressure injuries is minimizing prolonged pressure under the sacral, ischial, and sacrococcygeal areas through movement and shifting of the body. Our team has developed two novel technologies that provide feedback to increase body movement to prevent pressure injuries. Both systems (WiSAT and AW-Shift) utilize advanced sensors placed either under or atop a wheelchair cushion that communicate to a mobile application (app) that can be viewed by the wheelchair user and\\/or caregiver on a smart phone or tablet. The systems provide feedback to the user to motivate the performance of pressure relieving behaviors. Our current NIH funded project is testing the effectiveness of the two systems to improve pressure-reducing in-seat body movement in adults with spinal cord injury and related disorders. Both systems have gone through an extensive user- centered design process with wheelchair users without significant cognitive disability, and the systems have been tailored for personal use by the wheelchair user.

These drugs are life-saving given the severity of seizure sequalae, but also life-threatening because of serious adverse events. Patients with AD\\/ADRD are particularly vulnerable given their high susceptibility to both stroke and adverse events. The decision to start and stop anticonvulsants also might change when the patient have AD\\/ADRD, in part because anticonvulsant therapy management becomes more complex when patients have difficulty with therapy having a narrow therapeutic range or difficulty recognizing early complication symptoms. There are no trial data to guide decisions about prophylaxis after an ischemic stroke among patients with or without AD\\/ADRD. The sparse and conflicted existing literature has been limited by the difficulty assessing relevant measures, e.g., stroke severity or AD\\/ADRD status, in claims. Medicare claims offer potential, but lack well-validated definitions for stroke severity, AD\\/ADRD status, seizures, or adverse effects. We will address these issues using a novel dataset with individual-level linked longitudinal information from registries, electronic health records, and Medicare claims, and will develop prediction models for key baseline and outcome variables. Then, using a random 20% sample of national traditional, fee-for-service Medicare claims over 18 years (2006-23), we will emulate clinical trials assessing two critical decisions in the setting of first mild to moderate ischemic stroke among patients with or without AD\\/ADRD: a) initiating outpatient prophylaxis versus not; and b) stopping prophylaxis at six months versus continuing. We will apply multiple analytical tools to address confounding and other challenges. We will stratify our population based on AD\\/ADRD status because the patterns of strokes, post-stroke seizures, and treatment complications differ among patients with compared to those without AD\\/ADRD, as could the clinical management patterns. We have three aims: 1) To validate claims-based prediction models for our study variables; 2) To emulate a clinical trial comparing outpatient prophylaxis initiation versus not; and 3) To emulate a clinical trial comparing stopping outpatient prophylaxis at six months versus continuing. This comparative safety study could inform future policy and clinical care and improve stroke and AD\\/ADRD care, e.g., through adjustments in Medicare quality incentives and clinical guidelines. Moreover, these data could help inform patients, families, clinicians, and policy makers about how we can improve care for patients who could require seizure prophylaxis. -- NARRATIVE Anticonvulsants are commonly prescribed to older adults after stroke to prevent seizures, but these drugs may not be necessary or the harms could outweigh the benefits.

We believe informatics methods and tools proposed here will improve current practice on phenotypic data management and analysis, thus enhancing the reproducibility and quality of observational studies on AD\\/ADRD. -- Project Narrative Observational data, including electronic health records (EHR) and claims data, provide tremendous opportunities for clinical and translational research for Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementia (AD\\/ADRD). A key challenge is observational AD\\/ADRD research is to better manage and analyze phenotypic data. This project aims at developing novel informatics methods and tools to manage phenotype definitions and correct bias associated with phenotyping errors on local data, thus enhancing the reproducibility and quality of observational studies on AD\\/ADRD.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary\\/Abstract Nursing home (NH) residents with type 2 diabetes have substantial multimorbidity that complicates diabetes management. Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias affects nearly 50% of NH residents and may increase risk of hypoglycemia. Current NH diabetes management guidelines do not address Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias and current recommendations for NH target blood glucose ranges are based on expert opinion rather than evidence of adverse geriatric outcomes at certain thresholds of glycemia. To address these weaknesses, we propose the following aims: 1) to compare the incidence rates of hypo- and hyper-glycemia in the NH by dementia status, 2) to examine the acute effects of hypo- and hyper-glycemia on geriatric syndromes and evaluate whether Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias modifies glycemic thresholds, and 3) to examine the cumulative effects of hypo- and hyper-glycemia on cognitive decline and functional decline, and to determine whether baseline severity of Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias modifies glycemic thresholds. The proposed research leverages existing Veterans Affairs electronic health record databases, a unique source of routine fingerstick glucose measurements. The long-term goal of this research is to establish NH-specific target blood glucose ranges with thresholds of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that account for the presence of Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias. Dr. Lee seeks a K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to obtain essential skills and mentored research experience that will launch her career as an independent investigator in the field of aging, diabetes, and Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias. The five-year training plan will fill content gaps in geriatric syndromes and the assessment of Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias while building on her methodological strengths to include advanced causal inference methods and using electronic health records for research. Dr. Lee will complete the proposed research in the rich training environment of the UCSF Division of Geriatrics, with primary mentorship from geriatrics health services researcher Dr. Sei Lee, MD, MAS, Professor of Geriatrics at UCSF, co-mentorship by dementia expert Dr. Kristine Yaffe, MD, Professor of Psychiatry, Neurology and Epidemiology at UCSF, and aging epidemiologist Dr. Michelle Odden, PhD, Associate Professor of Epidemiology in the Division of Health Research and Policy at Stanford University. With the support of her mentors, co-mentors, and esteemed advisors, Dr. Lee will advance towards successfully competing for R01 funding and becoming a leader in geriatric diabetes. -- Project Narrative Type 2 diabetes affects nearly 1 in 3 NH residents, yet guidelines for the management of diabetes in NH are based on sparse evidence and do not adequately consider the impacts of comorbidities, especially Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias, on diabetes management. To improve the quality of care for vulnerable NH residents, it is critical to evaluate whether Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias increases the risk of developing hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in NH residents and whether Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias alters the thresholds of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that can cause adverse geriatric outcomes. Our proposal will use fingerstick glucose measurements taken from routine clinical care and captured in the Veterans Affairs electronic health record system to examine the complex relationships between Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and adverse geriatric outcomes in NH residents.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACT Hospitalizations and medication problems after discharge are a major risk factor for poor health outcomes in older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD). Increased preventable medication problems, such as unnecessary continuation of medications with neurocognitive adverse effects, emergency department visits, readmissions, and costs after hospitalization are a significant burden for older adults with ADRD. A better understanding of how patient and healthcare factors contribute to use of medications with neurocognitive effects and poor outcomes after hospitalization will inform policies to improve medication- related outcomes and care transitions in older adults with ADRD. This K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award application (PA-20-203) is to support Antoinette B. Coe, PharmD, PhD, a pharmacist-scientist and Assistant Professor in the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy. Dr. Coe's long-term goal is to become an independent investigator advancing the science of medication use in aging with a research program demonstrating ways to ensure safe and effective medication use in older adults, especially those who are vulnerable, cognitively impaired, and have ADRD. To achieve this goal, Dr. Coe will carry out the scientific aims of this proposal along with a robust career development plan in which she will acquire content expertise in cognitive impairment, ADRD, and aging, gain advanced epidemiology statistics training including causal inference methods, and develop an understanding of health and public policy impact on ADRD outcomes. The overarching scientific goal of this mentored-research proposal is to understand how poor outcomes related to medications with neurocognitive effects after a hospitalization can be mitigated in older adults with ADRD. This proposal leverages two existing Medicare care programs and payment policies that include medication reviews as potential solutions to reduce inappropriate neurocognitive medication use after care transitions: Medicare Part D Comprehensive Medication Reviews (CMR) and Part B Transitional Care Management (TCM) visits. Using nationally representative Medicare administrative data, the specific aims are as follows: 1) Identify predictors of inappropriate neurocognitive medication use in older adults with ADRD after hospitalization, 2) Examine the use of medication reviews (both CMR and TCM) among older adults who have been hospitalized and assess factors associated with their use, and 3) Test the effectiveness of comprehensive medication reviews and transitional care management on outcomes in older adults with ADRD after hospitalization. Dr. Coe will conduct all work at the rich environment of the University of Michigan, with an exceptional mentoring and advisory team led by Dr. Julie Bynum. The study's results will inform a large-scale R01-level application testing strategies to increase medication reviews in older adults with ADRD and their caregivers and motivate Medicare policy changes to ensure safe medication use in older adults with ADRD. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE Older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are more likely to be hospitalized and are at risk for medication and health problems after discharge, potentially worsened by new use of medications that affect cognition. This study will examine the effectiveness of two Medicare programs that provide medication reviews to reduce inappropriate medication use and adverse outcomes for older adults with dementia after hospitalization. This research will generate evidence to motivate health policy changes to improve the safe use of medications in older adults with dementia, a matter of national public health relevance and aligned with the mission of the National Institute on Aging (NIA).\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACT. Polypharmacy is a highly prevalent problem in older adults, particularly in those with Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementias (AD\\/ADRD) and those residing in the nursing home (NH). Many older adults continue to receive medications originally prescribed for disease prevention until the end of life, despite a lack of sufficient evidence to justify their continued use in advanced age. The use of bisphosphonates for fracture prevention is one example. Although bisphosphonates are effective in reducing fractures in healthier, community-dwelling individuals, there is insufficient evidence of continued benefits that is generalizable for NH residents with AD\\/ADRD. There is also substantial clinical heterogeneity in this population with regards to fracture risk, mobility, and life expectancy, creating further uncertainty as to whether all NH residents with AD\\/ADRD benefit from bisphosphonate use. Deprescribing is a patient-centered approach to reduce or stop medications that are no longer appropriate considering goals of care, time until benefit, and life expectancy. Considering the lack of strong generalizable evidence and potential for side effects, bisphosphonates may be targeted for deprescribing in NH residents with AD\\/ADRD. Deprescribing may also be justifiable considering the extended period of benefit of bisphosphonates, which may last for up to 2 years after discontinuation exceeding the life expectancy of many residents with AD\\/ADRD. However, no studies to date have evaluated the appropriateness of deprescribing bisphosphonates as a means to reduce the burden of polypharmacy and adverse effects in this population. Large observational studies of secondary data are uniquely positioned to evaluate the benefits and harms of medication use and deprescribing in older NH residents with AD\\/ADRD, given the barriers to conducting randomized studies in this population. This study will evaluate determinants, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of deprescribing bisphosphonates in NH residents with AD\\/ADRD. In Aim 1, we will conduct a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to identify determinants of deprescribing bisphosphonates from the perspectives of family\\/informal caregivers and prescribers of NH residents with AD\\/ADRD. In Aim 2, we will conduct an observational study of Medicare administrative data to evaluate clinical outcomes (fractures and adverse effects) associated with deprescribing bisphosphonates in a sample of older NH residents with AD\\/ADRD. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of deprescribing bisphosphonates in NH residents with AD\\/ADRD, considering medication costs and utilization for fractures and adverse effects. This study will address a critical gap in knowledge and inform future recommendations for optimizing bisphosphonate use to prevent fractures in this vulnerable and medically complex population. This award will also provide the principal investigator with protected time to develop skills in qualitative research methods, advanced techniques to reduce confounding in observational studies, and methods for cost-effectiveness analyses. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE. This proposal seeks to evaluate the risks and benefits of deprescribing versus continuing bisphosphonates in older nursing home residents with Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementias (AD\\/ADRD). This study will evaluate the qualitative perceptions of providers and caregivers, clinical outcomes, and healthcare- related costs to determine whether deprescribing bisphosphonates is a safe and reasonable strategy to reduce the medication burden for certain individuals in this population. The results from this study will contribute to the development of recommendations for the management of fracture prevention in older nursing home residents with AD\\/ADRD, a population not addressed in current guidelines\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary\\/Abstract This K23 award will establish Ishani Ganguli MD, MPH as a clinician-investigator focused on how care delivery and payment innovation can advance high-value outpatient care and better outcomes for older adults.

Ateev Mehrotra, Thomas Sequist), geriatrics (Dr. Christine Ritchie), primary care (Drs. Meredith Rosenthal, Joshua Metlay), quantitative methods (Drs. E. John Orav, J. Michael McWilliams, Craig Pollack), and EHR data analysis (Dr. Christine Vogeli). Primary care access and continuity of care improve outcomes for multimorbid older adults, so a recent decline in primary care office visit rates \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009c likely due in part to barriers attending these visits \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009c raises concerns. Virtual care may enable access and continuity. But we do not know which groups faced office visit barriers pre-dating the Covid-19 pandemic nor how post- pandemic expansion of virtual care will affect primary care access or continuity for these groups. To address these critical questions, Dr. Ganguli will first use the claims-linked Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey to describe visit use and visit continuity of care (COC) associated with reported trouble getting to the doctor\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s office and whether adults with AD\\/ADRD or social risk factors were at greater risk of this barrier (Aim 1).

Care management programs are a common approach to streamlining care for persons with conditions such as ADRD. Care management programs are typically siloed in individual settings; however, as older adults with ADRD utilize care in many settings, they are often contacted by multiple care management programs. Simultaneous enrollment in more than one care management program (hereafter \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c5\\u0093simultaneous enrollment\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d) may paradoxically lead to less coordinated care if the programs do not collaborate. The prevalence and consequences of simultaneous enrollment in ADRD are unclear. This K23 proposal builds upon the candidates' work funded by the Grants for Early Medical\\/Surgical Subspecialists' Transitioning to Aging Research (GEMSSTAR, R03) to advance understanding of the consequences of simultaneous enrollment and the acceptability and potential design of a primary care-based collaborative approach to care management for older adults with ADRD. Aim 1 will result use a novel linked dataset that includes care management enrollment data from two health systems in Baltimore and statewide hospital and emergency department utilization data to determine whether simultaneous enrollment in care management is: (1) more common among older adults with ADRD and (2) associated with preventable hospital and emergency department use. Aim 2 will use qualitative interviews with four groups of stakeholders (care management program leaders and staff, primary care clinicians and office staff, health information technology experts, older adults with ADRD and their family caregivers) to identify barriers and facilitators to and the design of a primary care-based collaborative approach to care management for older adults with ADRD. Aim 3 will pilot test a primary care based collaborative approach to care management for older adults with ADRD focused on feasibility and acceptability. The proposed research will contribute needed evidence about how to best approach care for older adults with ADRD in the context of population health initiatives such as care management. The candidate is a geriatrician who has already demonstrated a strong track record of academic scholarship with numerous publications and early investigator grants. She has proposed a comprehensive set of training activities that are geared toward her development as a clinician investigator and national leader who informs improvements to care delivery for older adults with ADRD. The project will foster her continued career development in the following ways (1) additional coursework and experience in advanced statistical methods, (2) developing a foundational understanding of bioinformatics, (3) applied experience in intervention design in the context of ADRD care, (4) improving her understanding of population health initiatives. She has assembled an exemplary mentoring team with expertise in the subject area and the relevant research methods and works in a rich research environment with tremendous resources to support her development. -- Delivering coordinated, comprehensive care to older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) is challenging.

The best way to lower costs and treat these conditions effectively is early diagnosis and treatment. Current clinical management for these conditions, as well as many others, include monitoring of specific excreta characteristics including urine color, urination frequency, urine duration, stool color, stool frequency and stool consistency. These logs are the best tool doctors currently have to screen for conditions such as UTIs, infectious diarrhea, dehydration, chronic kidney disease, GI bleeding, GU surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, and constipation, that can lead to hospitalizations and readmissions. However, these logs are on average 61% inaccurate at reporting adverse episodes such as diarrhea. Toi Labs has developed the patented TrueLoo technology to take pictures of excreta and, using machine learning algorithms, classify the toileting event using Digital Biomarkers (DBMs). The ability to create an excreta log to accurately deliver detailed information to doctors and healthcare providers can revolutionize healthcare by notifying when further screening (urine or fecal) is necessary. This novel, low-cost approach of machine learning and image identification technology that requires no change in behavior of the user will enable currently undetectable links between medical records and specific excreta patterns. In the future, the machine learning algorithm may be able to determine links between these excreta logs and the onset of specific diseases.

Dementia is of major clinical policy concern because it results in both inexorable clinical decline and extremely high costs of care. People with HIV are at particularly high risk because they often have major risk factors for the development of traditional etiologies of dementia, such as Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (AD\\/ADRD), and they also have a risk of HIV-associated neurocognitive disease (HAND) despite sustained virologic suppression. Depression, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and HIV are known to have potent synergies that contribute to the development of dementia. These comorbidities are modifiable risk factors for dementia that are highly prevalent, known to be undertreated in people with HIV, and likely to be clinically and economically important targets for prevention and management. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide an evidence-based approach for prioritizing and advocating for interventions to improve the quality of life and reduce morbidity and mortality among people aging with HIV. The benefits of reducing the burden of depression and CVD among people with HIV may currently be underestimated, given that concomitant benefits related to multimorbidity are often not captured due to short durations of observational or trial data. Determining which interventions are most clinically effective and cost- effective is critically important to understand so that people aging with HIV can benefit from strategies to reduce their risk of dementia and multimorbidity as they age. We propose to: 1) develop the Cognitive impairment, HIV, Aging, heaRt, MEntal health, and Dementia (CHARMED) Model, including populating the model with clinical and outcomes data from the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD) and nationally-representative cost data; 2) project clinical and economic outcomes of people aging with HIV; and 3) perform cost-effectiveness analyses of targeted interventions to reduce the burden of depression and CVD and to quantify the resultant reduction in dementia and multimorbidity. This proposal comprises a unique collaboration of experts in methods that are complementary and essential to complete the research aims: clinical expertise, epidemiology of people aging with HIV, costing, simulation modeling, and cost-effectiveness analysis. The proposed innovative multimorbidity model will be the first to include these important comorbidities that are highly prevalent, demonstrate synergies that contribute to dementia, and are amenable to treatment. The model structure and parameterization can both be revised with the emergence of updated data and improved understanding of the synergies and pathophysiology. This simulation modeling approach will allow for analyses of clinical and policy questions that aim to improve clinical outcomes, improve quality of life, and reduce costs among people aging with HIV. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost half of all people diagnosed with HIV in the United States are older than 50 years and are expected to live near normal life expectancies given effective antiretroviral therapy; however, people aging with HIV are at increased risk for dementia, as well as depression and cardiovascular disease. In this project, we will develop a multimorbidity simulation model for dementia, depression, cardiovascular disease, and HIV and will use the model to project chronic disease outcomes, quality of life, and costs associated with aging.

Available measures that do have clinical importance may include abstract constructs and\\/or complex response formats (e.g. 7-point Likert-type or numerical scales) that are not optimal for persons with dementia. Interdisciplinary researchers are engaging in innovative, person-centered interventions grounded in therapeutic optimism but are constrained by instruments that primarily quantify negative behaviors, deficit, and decline, and\\/or by measuring broad constructs such as global quality of life. The NIH-PROMIS measures demonstrate the value of standardized, common datasets but they do not currently incorporate patient preferences and may not encapsulate the full range of positive outcomes. Persons living with AD would benefit from rigorous, multi-site psychosocial intervention trials using a common portfolio of robust measures sensitive to change and measures that capture modifiable aspects of living well with dementia over time. This project will develop the infrastructure for development, standardization and validation of new outcome measures and methods for psychosocial interventions in AD. Emphasis will be placed on measures that are clinically meaningful to persons living with AD as well as measures that capture modifiable elements of living with AD and related dementias. Measures that optimize longitudinal evaluation of psychosocial intervention for persons with co-occurring cognitive and sensory challenges will be prioritized.

Twenty-one percent of older adults with AD\\/ADRD have unplanned, and often preventable, hospital readmissions within 30-days, which are estimated to cost over $5.4 billion per year. The development of clinical data research networks (CDRN) and their large complex datasets including patient and clinical level data have led to the development of various models to predict readmissions. However, the existing models have not demonstrated adequate predictive capability. The opportunity to integrate nursing care plan (i.e., patient problems, goals, and interventions) to these large datasets can fill gaps and improve the accuracy of prediction models. The development of a research data infrastructure that supports the integration of nursing care plan data to CDRN datasets is therefore critical for understanding and improving interdisciplinary care aimed at reducing readmissions of older adults with AD\\/ADRD. In this project, we propose to expand the research infrastructure of the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium and Data Trust through the creation, for the first time, of a reusable and feasible data pipeline that will ultimately integrate key care plan data elements documented by nurses into the OneFlorida Data Trust. The long-term goal of our research program is to gain a deeper understanding of readmissions for the aging population with AD\\/ADRD through the availability of an expanded dataset with interdisciplinary data. We plan to carry out the following aims: Specific Aim 1 (R21 Phase): Develop and test a prototype pipeline for extracting, translating, and integrating problems and goals in nursing care plan data from the University of Florida (UF Health) into the statewide OneFlorida Data Trust. We will map the local vocabulary used to represent the two nursing data elements to nationally recognized terminology sets using natural language processing and have registered nurses validate the mapping results. We will then use automated scripts to replace the local vocabulary with the standardized terms and integrate the data into the Trust. Specific Aim 2 (R33 Phase): Convert and integrate into the Trust nursing interventions from UF Health. Specific Aim 3 (R33 Phase): Extract, convert, and integrate to the Trust nursing data from a second organization, using the pipeline from the R21 phase. Specific Aim 4 (R33 Phase): Construct and test readmissions prediction models for older adults (aged 65 and above) with AD\\/ADRD using pertinent variables from the Trust and environmental dataset linked to it. We will develop machine-learning models for predicting readmissions from the nursing care elements, other patient- level data in the Trust, and important environmental variables that influence post-discharge follow-up care. Our team will be among the first to develop sustainable data pipelines for transforming local nursing care plan data into standardized data for integration into a large dataset. Through this study, we will learn the improvements nurses, physicians, and other providers can make to prevent readmissions. -- Project Narrative We will expand a research infrastructure to support the integration of nursing care plan data to large complex datasets with patient and clinical level data.

Now in Phase II\\/Year II of its clinical trial, Healthy Design is preparing for imminent Launch. This project has high potential to lead to a paradigm shift in the care of older critically ill or confused patients by demonstrating that a novel restraint device reduces physical and cognitive impairment. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE To prevent self-removal of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes, and intravenous lines, older critically ill patients in the intensive care unit are often restrained with traditional wrist restraints causing agitation, increased use of sedatives, prolonged immobility, and delirium, all of which can lead to long-term cognitive impairment similar to Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease and Related Dementias.

An estimated 5.8 million Americans in 2020 live with Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s dementia and nearly half of nursing home and other long-term care residents have been diagnosed with a form of dementia. Challenges in infectious disease management in these care settings are increased by frequent interactions between patients, caregivers, staff, and visitors, as well as higher risk from contagion due to age and underlying health conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the issue due to the susceptibility of the elderly to the virus. Contact tracing to identify, test, and isolate those who may have been exposed to an infected person has traditionally been a manual, labor-intensive process. Many care facilities lack the financial, human, and logistical resources to track sufficient detail to retrace movements. For dementia patients in particular, limited recall of recent events and interactions, inability to respond to tracing questions, and potential distrust of tracers risk inaccurate data. Investment in human resources to perform contact tracing is costly, and ad hoc tracing can limit effective outcomes. Existing methods to automate contact tracing have largely been smartphone software applications, widely criticized for lack of privacy protection, and in long-term care settings, guarantees on mobile phone use are limited. The few available solutions for care facilities rely on non-discreet wearable devices that, due to unfamiliarity, may be unacceptable to dementia patients, and often require large infrastructure additions with limitations on range. Therefore, there exists a significant unmet need to support care facilities by providing an unobtrusive, on- demand, accurate, and automated contact tracing solution that works both indoors and outdoors with little to no infrastructure requirements, and that addresses the special needs of dementia patients. ASTER Labs\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2 proposed Activtrace system leverages intelligent processing of WiFi, GPS, cellular, and inertial sensor data from a small hardware suite concealed in a shoe insole, unnoticeable to the wearer, that achieves high- precision location and duration of close-contact encounters in complex indoor and outdoor environments. In Phase I, the prototype system will be assembled, and feasibility will be demonstrated by determining the positional and temporal accuracy of the device in timed motion experiments, and through a focus group study with contact tracers and caregivers in senior care settings. Phase I testing will provide the success criteria for the start of the Phase II program. In Phase II, the pre-production insoles and comprehensive software application will be assembled, and the integrated system evaluated in a study with research actors wearing the insoles, along with confederate targets. Comparisons of results done manually by trained contact tracers and the automated Activtrace solution in multiple planned scenarios will establish the system\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s efficacy. -- Project Narrative Large increases in the elderly population suffering from dementia in the United States have presented significant challenges to management of infectious disease outbreaks in long-term care facility settings.

A poor understanding of its etiology has hindered progress toward treatments and preventive strategies. Several lines of evidence suggest that cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and various CVD risk factors are strongly associated with incidence of dementia. Vascular risk factors are easily identifiable and often modifiable. Therefore, discovery of vascular risk factors that precede CVD and cognitive impairment or decline would significantly enhance our understanding of the vascular etiology of ADRD. Heart rate variability (HRV) and QT interval variability (QTV), derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, are well-known indices of autonomic control over the heart. Lower HRV and higher QTV, indicating worse cardiac autonomic function, are strongly predictive of future cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Notably, lower HRV and QT abnormalities have been noted in ADRD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Thus, the study of HRV and QTV may provide valuable insight into the role of cardiac autonomic function in the development of dementia. However, in most studies HRV and QTV are derived from standard short-term ECG (ranging from 10 seconds to several minutes duration), which does not reflect real-world conditions due to the requirement of stationarity. Although wearable devices such as Zio XT Patch allow ECG recording of up to 14 days duration, methods used to analyze HRV and QTV are based on the stationarity assumption, resulting in measures that may be uninterpretable or misleading when applied to such extra long-term recordings. Thus, innovative signal analysis tools are required to utilize the full potential of these ECGs. Recently, a new signal processing method was developed specifically to derive novel measures of HRV and QTV from extra long-term ECG that better represent cardiac autonomic function in real-world settings. The primary goal of this K01 mentored career development award is to implement this innovative analysis tool in a large, ongoing cohort study of older adults to derive novel measures of HRV and QTV from recently collected 14-day Zio Patch recordings. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the association of these novel measures with cognitive performance and risk of prevalent or incident MCI or dementia. In Aim 2, we will determine if their diurnal variation is related to worse cognitive performance or risk of MCI or dementia. Finally, we will leverage recent neuroimaging data in a subset of participants to determine if extra long-term HRV or QTV is associated with neuroimaging biomarkers of ADRD or cerebrovascular disease. If successful, the proposed study may provide insight into the mechanisms linking vascular risk factors and CVD to ADRD, and potentially identify cardiac autonomic function as a modifiable intervention target. In addition, this K01 award will provide the resources necessary to support the Candidate\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s transition to an independent research career in an area of growing public health importance. -- Project Narrative A poor understanding of the vascular etiology of Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease and related dementias has hindered progress toward treatments and preventive strategies in older adults. Cardiac autonomic dysfunction, indexed by lower heart rate variability (HRV) or higher QT interval variability (QTV), may be associated with worse cognitive performance and incident dementia, yet most studies of HRV and QTV are limited by their short-term duration or imprecise computation that does not accurately capture autonomic function in real-world settings. The goal of this K01 Mentored Career Development Award is to obtain training in computing novel measures of extra long-term (14-day duration) ambulatory HRV and QTV that better represent autonomic function using an innovative signal processing method, and initiate a mentored research project to determine their association with cognitive performance and dementia risk in a large cohort of older US adults.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary  The burden of high blood pressure, a major public health problem, is aggravated by an aging human population. A plethora of experimental data points to angiotensin II (Ang II), as the major contributing factor in the development of hypertension-related target organ damage. Although data suggested that classic RAS inhibitors exert positive therapeutic benefits multi-center studies of the long-term effects of these drugs on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality showed an effectiveness similar to other classes of antihypertensive drugs. Our hypothesis is that cardiac and renal Ang-(1-12), as a primary precursor for non-renin dependent Ang II generation, may account for the progressive development of pressure-related target organ damage. The major goal of this project is to evaluate the therapeutic effects of monoclonal antibodies (mABs) and cell penetrating nanobodies (Nbs) against the human sequence of Ang-(1-12) through combining high efficacy with improve treatment adherence.

These measures to be taken before and at 1 and 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with either Ang-(1-12) mAbs or nanobodies (NB). The effectiveness of this immunotherapy in blood pressure control will be further quantified in experiments in which antibodies are given to transgenic hypertensive rats in combination with lisinopril or valsartan. The proposed highly innovativestudies will provide a conceptual basis for novel hypertension treatment strategies involving neutralization of Ang-(1-12). -- Project Narrative Angiotensin II (Ang II), an effector hormone of the renin angiotensin system (RAS), has a major role in the development and progression of adverse cardiac and vascular remodeling in the elderly, yet classic inhibitors of its synthesis and actions do not offer a full spectrum of cardiovascular protection. The studies in this project would provide a conceptual basis for a heretofore non-recognized novel prevention and treatment strategy based on immunosuppression of Ang II through targeting non-renin dependent Ang-(1-12) pathway for Ang II formation. Animal research employing a humanized model of hypertension in rats engineered to express the human angiotensinogen gene will document the benefit of immunoneutralization of this Ang II-forming substrate in terms of reversing hypertension, halting the progressionof adverse cardiac remodeling and left ventricular dysfunction, and improving renal function.\"},{\"abstract\":\"ABSTRACT Chronic infections like cytomegalovirus (CMV) may contribute to both cognitive and physical function decline in older adults and have been implicated in the development of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and frailty. Due to immune senescence and immune suppression, older Kidney Transplant (KT) recipients \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b0\\u00c2\\u00a550 years, are at especially high risk of early and frequent reactivations of latent CMV and may fail to reconstitute CMV-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMV-CMI), leading to high rates of CMV disease. This research will investigate for the first time the role of CMV and CMV-CMI reconstitution in cognitive and physical functional decline in KT recipients. This research is relevant to the NIA mission because it will advance the understanding of the critical mechanisms driving CMV-related aging in older adults by studying the impact of CMV on decline in cognitive and physical function, AD, and frailty.  This proposal's central hypothesis is that inflammation secondary to CMV replication may explain the mechanism by which CMV may contribute to cognitive and physical function decline, AD, and progression of frailty. This hypothesis will be tested through the following specific aims: 1) To quantify the association of CMV serostatus with trajectories of cognition and physical function in an existing Functional Assessment of Renal Disease (FAIR) cohort of older KT recipients; 2) To assess the relationship of CMV-CMI reconstitution with trajectories of cognitive and physical function and frailty in a newly established Colorado cohort of CMV+ older KT recipients; 3) To investigate the relationship of inflammatory markers with trajectories of cognition and physical function among CMV+ and CMV- KT recipients at 1-year post-KT in Colorado cohort.  This approach is innovative because it: 1) allows the first investigation of the relationship of CMV, with the trajectories of cognitive and physical function among older KT recipients, and 2) may identify the role of CMV-CMI and inflammation driving the relationship of CMV with cognitive and physical function decline. This project is significant because it has the potential to improve health outcomes for older KT recipients. Complimentary to the proposed research plan, a five-year mentored career development training plan has been devised that incorporates research training in geriatrics and viral immunology. The candidate is co- mentored by internationally recognized experts in gerontology, viral immunology, kidney transplantation, and epidemiology. The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator studying immune protection in the context of chronic viral infections with geriatric outcomes. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE Older kidney transplant (KT) recipients are at higher risk of cognitive and physical function decline, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and frailty compared to their healthy community-dwelling older adult counterparts; post-transplant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and subsequent inflammation may play a critical mechanistic role, and is a potentially preventable determinant of cognitive and physical function decline and frailty in older adults. This proposal aims to understand the effect of CMV, CMV cell mediated immune reconstitution (CMV-CMI), and inflammation on decline in cognitive and physical function, AD, and frailty among older KT recipients. Our exploration of CMV, CMV-CMI, cognitive and physical function decline in a novel population of older KT recipients will directly benefit this uniquely vulnerable population and guide their physicians by helping to inform risk prediction, guide clinical decision making, and possibly even offer clues into underlying physical and cognitive reserve mechanisms that may relate to cognitive decline, AD and frailty among healthy community-dwelling older adults.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT ABSTRACT The purpose of this K23 career development award is to support Dr. Ackenbom's long term career goal of becoming an independent surgeon-scientist advancing knowledge on cognitive impairment after surgery used to improve surgical outcomes and quality of life for older patients. Recognizing postoperative neurocognitive disorder (pNCD), previously termed postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), in surgical patients is essential as it is associated with delayed postoperative recovery, greater loss of independence, increased morbidity, mortality, and substantial health care costs. In the United States, approximately 35% of all surgeries are performed on adults \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b0\\u00c2\\u00a565 years, and with the increase in the aging population, the number of surgeries and thus pNCD incidence is expected to rise. pNCD\\/POCD is characterized as a largely transient deterioration of concentration, information processing, and memory often lasting days to months, but there are studies reporting cognitive impairment after surgery lasting years. Cognitive impairment occurring more than 12 months after surgery is concerning for an ongoing diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or other cognitive diagnoses, inclusive of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).There is a critical research need to examine the longitudinal course of cognitive impairment after surgery and its influence on everyday functioning, independence, and quality of life as it is not well understood. We propose a study using linked 2011-2017 data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a population-based study focused on late-life functioning over time, with Medicare claims data, inclusive of surgical data variables as well as building upon a surgical patient cohort with available detailed neuropsychological testing results to address the following aims: 1) compare change in cognitive performance of persons \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b0\\u00c2\\u00a565 years who underwent major noncardiac elective surgery and those who did not, 2) compare change in everyday functioning in persons \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b0\\u00c2\\u00a565 years who underwent major noncardiac elective surgery and those who did not, 3) assess change in cognitive performance and diagnosis two years after prolapse surgery in women \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b0\\u00c2\\u00a570 years previously enrolled in Ackenbom et. al study assessing pNCD. The training aims in this proposal are: 1) To build on foundational knowledge in measurement of a range of cognitive abilities in clinical research settings and 2) To enhance my knowledge and understanding in research and clinical diagnosis and management of cognitive impairment disorders in general and in particular, ADRD, to incorporate into future study designs involving cognitive evaluation in perioperative settings. This study will determine appropriate effect sizes in preparation for future studies to conduct an extended assessment of cognitive performance and cognitive diagnoses, including pNCD and incident dementia, after undergoing major noncardiac elective surgery in persons \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00b0\\u00c2\\u00a570 years over a 5-year period. Further, achievement of these training aims will propel Dr. Ackenbom in her transition to independence as a clinical researcher in this important area of study. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive impairment associated with surgery is public health concern due to its association with decreased quality of life, increased morbidity\\/mortality and increased health care costs. This study will evaluate the relationship between major, noncardiac surgery and subsequent cognitive impairment, disability, and loss of independence in older adults. Our proposed study will further elucidate the natural history of postoperative cognitive decline and its impact on everyday functioning and independence.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Palakshappa 1K23AG073529-01  Critical illness leads to incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease and related dementias (ADRD) in many older adults. Roughly 2.5 million older adults are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) annually in the United States; of those, 1 in 4 have a degree of impairment similar in severity to mild ADRD 12 months after their ICU stay. Recognizing MCI or ADRD following critical illness is crucial for connecting patients and their caregivers with support, providing care recommendations known to decrease the progression of MCI to Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease (AD), and ultimately improving our understanding of modifiable risk factors that lead to this complication. As such, experts across disciplines recommend screening for MCI or AD following critical illness in high-risk patients; however, this has not been widely adopted. The overall objective of this mentored career development award is to obtain additional training in cognitive assessment and implementation science and use a mixed-methods approach to develop and pilot-test an implementation program to support screening for incident MCI or ADRD following critical illness in older adults. Aim 1 will develop and test a prediction model for incident MCI or AD following critical illness using Medicare claims data and then re-calibrate that model for use in the electronic health record (EHR), providing experiential learning in integrating prediction modeling with EHR data. In Aim 2, I will learn to use qualitative data to inform implementation by identifying facilitators and barriers to implementing cognitive screening specifically in the post-ICU population. In Aim 3, I will gain experience with the design and conduct of a pilot implementation trial and determine the feasibility and potential impact of Anticipating Dementia and Providing Therapy (ADAPT), an implementation program designed to support screening for MCI or ADRD following critical illness in our health system. I will capitalize on the outstanding research environment at Wake Forest School of Medicine as well as the support and guidance of an exceptionally qualified mentorship team (Drs. Williamson, Houston, Hanchate, Birken, Files, Meyer). Through didactic coursework, dedicated mentorship, and hands-on experience, I will obtain the necessary training in the integration of prediction modeling with EHR data, the use of qualitative data to inform implementation, and the design and conduct of a pilot implementation trial. I will also pursue additional training in cognitive assessment methods and geriatric principles, establishing an area of expertise linking critical illness, aging and cognition, and implementation science. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research K23 will advance our understanding of how best to identify and support older adults with MCI or ADRD after critical illness and it will help me to achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist dedicated to improving the care we deliver to older adults during and after critical illness. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE New or worsening cognitive impairment following critical illness is a major public health problem affecting older adults. With the proposed Mentored Career Development Award, I will obtain the additional training in cognitive assessment and implementation science that I need to develop and test a program to screen for and support patients and caregivers suffering from this important complication. I anticipate that the proposed research program could transform care for older adults by improving our ability to predict those at increased risk for post intensive care cognitive impairment and connecting patients and their families with resources that may prevent ongoing cognitive decline.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary Injuries are a leading cause of emergency department visits among older adults. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are at particular risk of injuries, primarily due to falls. Lower levels of direct care staffing are related to injuries in nursing homes. Currently, nothing is known regarding the relationship between direct care staffing levels and injury-related emergency department (ED) use in assisted living (AL) communities. Approximately 40% of the 800,000 individuals in AL communities have ADRD. Although AL communities provide housing, personal care, at least two meals a day, and oversight 24 hours a day, they are not required to provide round-the-clock nursing services. Also unlike nursing homes, AL communities are regulated at the state level rather than the federal level. As a result, direct care staffing levels and policies are variable among and within states. The goal of the proposed project is to examine whether direct care staffing levels and policies are associated with injury-related ED use among AL residents with ADRD. For the first aim, we will examine whether AL direct care staffing levels are associated with injury- related ED visits among AL residents with ADRD. Specifically, using 2007 to 2019 of Ohio's Biennial Survey of Long-Term Care Facilities linked to Medicare claims, we will examine the relationship between changes in direct care staffing levels and injury-related ED use among AL residents with ADRD in the state of Ohio. For the second aim, using a database of state staffing regulations, we will examine how states' changes in policies related to minimum direct care staffing levels affect injury-related ED use among Medicare-enrolled AL residents with ADRD between 2007 and 2019.The project is expected to improve the delivery of care to the residents who live in AL communities with ADRD. States and AL communities can use the information gained from this study to inform policies and practices related to direct care staffing levels. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is relevant to public health because it examines the relationship between direct care staffing levels and injury-related emergency department use among assisted living residents with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), a population that is particularly vulnerable to injuries. Additionally, this project will leverage existing sources of data to pursue NIA's Goal 2 of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease to \\\"enhance care quality\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d for individuals with ADRD.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACT Cognitive decline associated with cancer and its therapies, or cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), is a dreaded outcome among older adults with cancer who care about how well they can live after surviving serious illness. In older adults, cognitive decline can have wide-ranging impact on quality of life, functional decline, and loss of independence. However, oncologists have little information to guide counseling on the cognitive risks of cancer and its associated therapies. The existing literature on CRCI, mostly in solid tumors such as breast cancer, report conflicting results and have several limitations, such as difficulty accounting for the multiple factors that influence cognition and lack of information about long-term pre- and post-cancer cognitive trajectories. CRCI is particularly relevant to patients with hematologic malignancies since most have the potential for cure or long-term disease control. However, our understanding of CRCI in hematologic malignancies is limited, which impedes our ability to counsel patients on what to expect cognitively or to identify patients at high-risk of cognitive decline. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the long-term cognitive trajectories of older adults aged >65 years with hematologic malignancies and identify predictors of cognitive decline by leveraging data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which is a longitudinal cohort of nationally representative older adults. We will examine changes in the cognitive trajectories of older adults with hematologic malignancies from years before treatment to years after and compare them to changes in cognitive trajectories in matched non-cancer controls (Aim 1 primary analysis). Because hematologic malignancies and treatments are heterogeneous, we will also characterize the cognitive trajectories of older adults with hematologic malignancies based on clinically relevant disease types, and we will also describe the different types of cognitive trajectories that may exist (Aim 1 secondary analysis). Lastly, we will seek to identify predictors of clinically meaningful cognitive decline with a focus on disease\\/treatment-related variables and modifiable risk factors that will inform treatment discussions and the design of interventions (Aim 2). This study will help fill the critical knowledge gap about the cognitive trajectories of older hematologic malignancy survivors by comparing the change in cognition to what happens with normal aging, characterizing potentially different trajectories based on clinically relevant disease types, and describing different types of trajectories that patients may experience. In addition, the identification of predictors of clinically meaningful cognitive decline will provide important prognostic information to inform treatment discussions and lay the groundwork for the development of future screening tools to identify high-risk subgroups and interventions to mitigate the risk of CRCI. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE The National Institute on Aging has called for increased research to advance our progress against Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease and related dementias, yet in oncology research there are still major knowledge gaps in cancer-related cognitive impairment, particularly in hematologic malignancies. We propose a study to better characterize the long-term cognitive trajectories of older adults with hematologic malignancies and to identify predictors of clinically meaningful cognitive decline. The results of this study will improve our ability to counsel patients with hematologic malignancies on what to expect cognitively and to identify those at high-risk of cognitive decline for targeted screenings or interventions.\"}]", "httpMethod": "POST"}
