{"body": "[{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary Fifty million people worldwide have dementia, and there are nearly 10 million new cases every year. The subtypes of dementia include Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies, and a group of diseases that contribute to frontotemporal dementia. Early and accurate diagnosis of the dementia cause is crucial because it can lead to the timely provision of symptomatic treatment and avoidance of medications that may worsen symptoms and assist in developing and evaluating new drugs and gaining access to effective treatments when they become available. There has thus been extensive research on developing accurate classifiers (e.g., linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, multiclass logistic regression, random forests, boosting, convolutional neural network) to automatically classify dementia into different classes. In most existing work, the classifiers are designed to maximize overall accuracy. Since different types of classification error may have different consequences (costs), it is highly desirable to develop multiclass classifiers with prioritized error control. There is a rich literature on binary classifiers that minimize the false negative rate, with false positive rate controlled under a particular level. A prominent example is the Neyman-Pearson classification framework. However, the extension of the framework to multiclass classification, in conjunction with the desired prioritized error controls, while of vital importance, remains largely unknown. This project fills this gap by developing a general framework for multiclass classification with controls for misclassification errors, while imposing various (relative) costs for another set of misclassification error types. This can be viewed as a unification of cost-sensitive learning and the Neyman-Pearson classification in the multiclass setting. The new methodological development will optimize clinical diagnosis in the multiclass setting and expedite drug discovery through more efficient clinical trials. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. To propose a flexible framework that includes prioritized error control requirements as well as costs for various classification error types, and develop an efficient umbrella algorithm to solve the associated constrained optimization problem. Aim 2. To study the feasibility of the optimization problem and the properties of the umbrella algorithm. Aim 3. To evaluate the proposed algorithm via extensive simulation studies, apply it to dementia subtype classification, and develop a publicly available R package. -- Project Narrative Dementia is a common syndrome with many different causes include Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease, vascular dementia, Parkinson\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and a group of diseases that contribute to frontotemporal dementia. We introduce a general framework for multiclass classification that can control selected types of misclassification errors, while imposing various costs for another set of misclassification error types.

As no drug yet prevents, delays, or reverses it, aging populations potentially face a tidal threat of incipient and socially disruptive Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease (AD) cases. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked over 100 loci with AD and explain much of population attributable risk, but only a fraction of heritability. This heritability gap means it remains difficult to design and assess which surveillance, screening, preventive, and stratification programs are effective. In turn, this hinders therapeutic trials. The challenge in translating genetic variants into patient classifications is twofold. First, AD is polygenic, so relevant disease driving mutations are spread thin across a multitude of different genes and patients. Second, current interpretations of the deleterious effects of mutations lack accuracy, so the impactful few cannot be distinguished from the benign multitude in any given subject. These problems compound and fog the statistical genetics of AD risk and morbidity with poor signal to noise ratio. The crux of our solution is to add a massive amount of new information, exploit it efficiently through computation, then perform rigorous multi-pronged experimental validation. We start from the hypothesis that AD arises through mutational perturbations that affect functional pathways beyond the built-in evolutionary tolerances. New algorithms compute these excessive mutational forces and place them in integrative machine learning frameworks to sort between AD patients and controls, and which can also reflect functional interactions among proteins or genes. Innovations include a mathematical model of evolution based on calculus; ensemble machine learning over human genome variations; and harmonic analysis of mutational perturbations in functional networks. The outcome will, for the first time, integrate genomic variations relevant to AD in the context of all relevant evolutionary history and all known functional interactions. In practice, this will increase power and resolution, enable gender-specific analysis and AD stratification of men and women, and identify new and experimentally validated AD genes. To carry out this program, AIM 1 will fuse a novel mathematical analysis of evolution with machine learning and network wavelet theory. This will yield complementary integrative approaches to identify genes and mutations that sort AD vs healthy subjects based on the abnormal mutational burden of rare gene variants in sequenced cohorts. AIM 2 will focus similar tools on patients and controls with known paradoxical phenotypes that run counter to their APOE\\u00c3\\u0089\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00ba2\\/4 status. The results will identify modifier genes that drive AD in APOE\\u00c3\\u0089\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00ba2 carriers or that protect APOE\\u00c3\\u0089\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00ba4 carriers from AD. AIM 3 will provide direct experimental validation, leveraging high-throughput, robot-assisted genetic modifier screening in Drosophila models of Tau or amyloid-beta peptide neurotoxicity. Promising targets will be further confirmed in mammalian neuronal cell culture. The work will validate a new approach to enlarge our understanding of genetic complexity in Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease for the identification of gene drivers and modifiers to guide clinical assessment of AD risk stratification. -- Cognitive Computing of Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease Genes and Risk Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease (AD) is devastating and its social and economic impact is projected to rise dramatically. Here, in order to discover genes that underlie its mechanisms and clinical risk, we fuse a new mathematical and machine learning framework with experimental testing in diverse models. The outcome will integrate vast amounts of data from evolution, from genome sequencing from experiments and from patients to guide clinical assessment of risk and open new paths for understanding the disease and for drug development.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY Predisposition to AD involves a complex, polygenic, and pleiotropic genetic architecture; furthermore, there are no disease modifying treatments that slow the neurodegenerative process for AD. Traditional reductionist paradigms overlook the inherent complexity of AD and have often led to treatments that are lack of clinical benefits or fraught with adverse effects. Existing multi-omics data resources, including genetics, genomics, transcriptomics, interactomics (protein-protein interactions and chromatin interactions), have not yet been fully utilized and integrated to explore the pathobiology and drug discovery for AD. Understanding AD genetics and genomics from the point-of-view of how cellular systems and molecular interactome perturbations underlie the disease (termed disease module) is the essence of network medicine. Systematic identification and characterization of novel underlying pathogenesis and disease module, will serve as a foundation for identifying and validating novel risk genes and drug targets in AD. Given our preliminary results, we posit that a genome- wide, multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) framework to identify new risk genes and networks from human genome\\/exome sequencing and multi-omics findings enable a more complete mechanistic understanding of AD pathogenesis and the rapid development of targeted therapeutic intervention for AD with great success. Aim 1 will determine whether rare coding and non-coding variants by whole-genome\\/exome sequencing (WGS\\/WES) are enriched in protein-functional and gene-regulatory regions using sequence and structure-based deep learning models. These analyses will assemble WGS\\/WES and clinical data from Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), publicly available protein structure (i.e., protein-protein interfaces, protein-ligand binding sites, post-translational modifications) and sequence (expression quantitative trait locus [eQTLs], histone-QTLs, and transcription factor binding-QTLs) information from the PDB database, GTEx, NIH RoadMap, FANTOM5, PsychENCODE, and NIH 4D Nucleome. Aim 2 will determine whether GWAS common variants linked to AD pathobiology and endophenotypes are enriched in gene regulatory networks in a cell-type specific manner using a Bayesian framework. We will validate risk gene and network findings using WGS\\/WES and protein panel expression data from our existing cohorts: The Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease Biobank (CBH-Biobank) and the Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (CADRC). Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that risk genes and networks can be modulated via in silico drug repurposing, population-based validation, and functional test, to identify candidate agents and drug combinations that will modify AD. The successful completion of this project will offer capable and intelligent computer-based toolboxes that enable searching, sharing, visualizing, querying, and analyzing genetics, genomics, and multi-omics profiling data for genome-informed therapeutic discoveries for AD and other neurodegenerative disease if broadly applied. -- Project Narrative It is estimated that more than 16 million people with AD live in the United States by 2050 and the predisposition to AD involves a complex, polygenic, and pleiotropic genetic architecture. This proposal will develop intelligent computer-based network medicine and systems biology tools, capable of identifying and validating human genome sequencing findings for novel risk gene discoveries and targeted therapeutic development in AD. The innovative network-based, artificial intelligence toolboxes and novel risk genes and biologically relevant targeted therapeutic approaches developed in this proposal will prove to be novel and effective ways to improve outcomes in long-term brain care for the rapidly growing AD population, an essential goal of AD precision medicine.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia characterized by progressive loss of cognitive function. Unfortunately, currently there is no effective treatment for AD and clinical interventions of AD have largely failed despite enormous efforts. For the current application, we seek to develop multimodal machine learning models by leveraging the rich collection of AD-related omics data and phenotypical data recently generated from large-scale collaborative projects such as Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD (AMP-AD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). Three aims will be pursued in the current application. Aim 1. We will build an expandable multimodal unsupervised machine learning framework to investigate AD heterogeneity. Given the multifactorial nature of AD, we will perform AD subtyping by harnessing the rich information across multiple spectrum of data. Aim 2. We will build an expandable multimodal supervised machine learning framework to quantify AD risk from longitudinal follow up of cognitively normal elders. The models will be built from genetic susceptibility and gene regulatory information as well as endophenotypes measured when participants were cognitive normal. Aim 3. We will build AD-related gene interaction networks in post-mortem human brain samples. We will examine the association of multiple omics data with AD in brain samples, and build tissue-specific interaction networks to understand potential molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis. The present application represents an innovative approach to identify individuals at high risk of AD from both clinical and genetic risk factors in ethnically diverse populations. The outlined strategy will provide new insights into the risk stratification and prevention strategies for AD. We also commit to share our methods through GitHub or CRAN for free access across the scientific community. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia but therapeutic clinical trials for AD have largely failed. The objective of our proposal is to develop and apply multimodal machine learning methods that can identify patterns and\\/or clusters with similar characteristics using extremely large amounts of data such as have been generated by the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) and other large-scale collaborative projects. We will apply these methodsto investigate AD heterogeneity and identify people with high AD risk before symptoms are observed, which might provide new avenues for better diagnosis and treatment of AD.\"}]", "httpMethod": "POST"}
