{"body": "[{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACT TITLE: Dietary Restriction, GH\\/IGF-1 and Mechanisms of Cellular Protection and Regeneration ABSTACT: Age is the major risk factor for many morbidities including cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Biogerontology research is well positioned to help prevent or at least delay these diseases by identifying safe strategies to retard aging so that the degree and type of cellular damage does not reach the threshold leading to disease incidence or progression. Here we propose to bring together two biogerontology laboratories from the University of Southern California School of Gerontology and a laboratory from Harvard University to study the molecular mechanisms linking fasting, fasting mimicking diets and protein restriction to reduced nutrient signaling, the stress resistance signaling network, the mitochondrial peptide humanin, and in turn, cellular protection, regeneration, and healthspan. These studies will contribute to the identification of drugs and dietary interventions to treat as well as prevent multiple diseases by acting on the aging process and on multi-system regeneration and rejuvenation. An important advantage of the dietary interventions being tested is that they are periodic and therefore have the potential to match and possibly surpass the beneficial effects of chronic calorie restriction while minimizing the burden of chronic and extreme diets, but also minimizing adverse effects.  This P01 application consists of 3 major projects, an Animal and Biostatistics Core, and an Administrative Core. Our common goals are to: 1) identify and study novel periodic dietary interventions that promote healthspan without causing adverse effects at old ages; 2) study the mechanisms of fasting mimicking diet- and protein restriction-dependent cellular protection, regeneration and rejuvenation with focus on the hematopoietic and nervous systems; 3) understand the link between dietary interventions, growth pathways and humanin to test the hypothesis that this mitochondrial peptide functions as a healthspan mediator and determine whether it can serve as a fasting\\/protein restriction mimetic; 4) test the hypothesis that endogenous H2S is a key mediator of the protective effects of dietary interventions including fasting, fasting mimicking diets and protein restriction on resistance to ischemic and genotoxic injury to organs and cells, and study the regulation of cysteine gamma lyase-mediated endogenous H2S production by dietary restriction, growth factors and humanin.  The unique background of each PI and the close collaboration between them has generated and will continue to generate new hypotheses, novel cellular and mouse models, as well as technical and conceptual developments. These advances will undoubtedly accelerate the research progress and support the development of clinical trials to improve human health in ways that could not be achieved by each laboratory performing research independently. -- OVERALL NARRATIVE We propose to bring together two biogerontology laboratories from the University of Southern California and a laboratory from Harvard University to study the molecular mechanisms linking fasting, fasting mimicking diets and protein restriction to growth genes, the stress resistance signaling network, mitochondrial biology, cellular protection, regeneration, and aging.

The circadian dysregulation is more pronounced in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where disrupted sleep and circadian cycles are increasingly appreciated as a potential disease-driving factor. Importantly, intervention studies support a positive modifiable function of the clock to promote healthy aging. We previously identified a natural compound Nobiletin (NOB) as a clock- enhancing molecule which activates the ROR nuclear receptors in the cellular oscillator to increase circadian amplitude, improve metabolic health and promote healthy aging. Likewise, several dietary interventions that prolong healthy lifespan and\\/or longevity, including caloric restriction and time-restricted feeding in the active phase (TRF), were also found to enhance circadian gene oscillation and output metabolism. Preliminary studies support beneficial roles of NOB and TRF against AD; however, their synergistic function and mechanism remain unknown.  In the parent R01 grant (R01AG065984) entitled \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c5\\u0093Concerted enhancement of core and output rhythms to promote healthy aging\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d, we investigate a concerted function of NOB and TRF to strengthen the clock and delay peripheral age-related decline. The current administrative supplement proposal is in response to NOT-AG-20- 034. Building on our recent preliminary results showing beneficial effects of NOB to improve pathology and behavior in an AD mouse model, we hypothesize that TRF synergizes with NOB to coordinately activate circadian functions to decelerate AD-related decline. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of TRF.NOB against pathological and behavioral decline in APP\\/PS1 mice. In Aim 2, we will investigate circadian physiological cycles, and determine changes in circadian and AD gene expression in the hippocampus and the cortex. This project is well aligns with the parent project in experimental design and methodologies, and importantly will begin to address a key knowledge gap regarding a role of NOB and TRF against neurodegeneration in AD mice. The ultimate goal is to determine whether and how the clock can be activated by this powerful dual- modality intervention to delay AD progression. Based on our serial studies on NOB and the promising and readily translatable TRF strategy, these studies will reveal a candidate therapeutic strategy against AD pathology\\/behavior. The innovations include a conceptual paradigm of the NOB.TRF regimen for AD, and novel circadian mechanisms in key brain regions for AD gene expression. Given the pressing needs to counter the rapidly aging population, the 24\\/7 ad libitum lifestyle that disrupts natural circadian rhythms, and the imminent crisis of AD, such a versatile and feasible intervention will have an immediate and long-lasting impact on the quality of life in the elderly and AD patients. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE Relevance to public health: Circadian disruption is prevalent in modern lifestyles, exacerbating disease risk and age-related decline. The proposed studies will illuminate a dual-modality intervention strategy, integrating the clock-enhancing compound Nobiletin with time-restricted feeding, to improve circadian rhythms and hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease in mouse models. The study will ultimately establish an implementable circadian intervention to prolong healthspan and improve quality of life at old ages.\"},{\"abstract\":\"SUMMARY Caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, time restricted feeding\\/eating, fasting mimicking diet, and the fuel- switching linked to exercise have all shown evidence of improving metabolic and brain health. Studies funded through the parent grant will be the first to directly address the specific roles of ketone metabolism upon the metabolic, energetic, neuromodulatory, and cognitive benefits conferred by intermittent metabolic switching, which has pleiotropic effects, including augmentation of ketone metabolism. Although focused on neurometabolic declines associated with aging, none of the studies funded through the parent grant directly addresses the role of nutrient oscillations, fuel switching, or ketone metabolism in Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease (AD). However, extensive literature shows aberrant energy metabolism occurs in AD, including reduced glucose utilization during neurodegeneration. Mild cognitive impairment\\/AD also is associated with impaired insulin sensitivity and reduced VO2max compared to controls, factors both linked to mitochondrial function. A logical extension of impaired glucose metabolism is the understudied hypothesis that a ketogenic diet could symptomatically benefit AD subjects. Thus, multiple trials are targeting ketogenic diets to treat cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases, and other interventional approaches that provoke intermittent metabolic switching are also of great interest for AD therapy, including intermittent fasting. The central hypothesis of this supplemental application is that integrated ketone metabolism is responsible for the improvement in AD outcomes attributable to intermittent metabolic switching. The single Specific Aim is to use an accepted mouse model of AD to determine if oscillations in ketogenic flux via intermittent fasting not only provide fuel to the brain, but also improve molecular and histopathological outcomes. The rTg4510 (tauP301L bitransgenic) mouse model will be used to study the formation of neurofibrillary tangles associated with Alzheimer's disease. The effects of intermittent fasting, versus ad libitum-fed control, on metabolic and histopathological outcomes will be quantified in mice with hepatic ketogenic sufficiency and compared to those of mice with genetically programmed ketogenic insufficiency. Cutting edge metabolomics and metabolic flux analyses will be used to quantify brain glucose and ketone utilization, and molecular and histopathological approaches will be used to reveal effects on AD pathogenesis. IMPACT: The benefits of ketogenic therapies on health span are commonly presumed to occur through ketone metabolism, but this has never been proven. The experiments proposed for the Supplement will determine if ketone synthesis in liver for utilization in brain plays a mechanistic role in clinically relevant interventions for AD. Moreover, this work will elucidate specific therapeutic targets for individuals who cannot perform this lifestyle intervention but for whom other forms of ketone therapy might confer significant benefit to prevent or treat AD. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE Caloric restriction and exercise benefit brain health and metabolic health span. This project will test if liver ketone synthesis and neuronal ketone utilization are critical for the benefits of intermittent fasting and exercise on indices of brain health and metabolic health.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Abstract  As our population ages, there is a steep rise in the number of individuals with age associated illness including Alzheimer's disease resulting in a tremendous societal burden with explosive increases in health care costs.

My funded NIA grant (1R01AG064869), entitled \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c5\\u0093Nutrient-sensing GHS-R in macrophage reprogramming and inflamm- aging\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d, 7\\/1\\/2019- 4\\/30\\/2024, is not AD-focused. It investigates the roles of ghrelin receptor GHS- R in macrophage reprogramming in liver and adipose tissues during aging, focusing on immuno- metabolic regulation in peripheral tissues. Aging is associated with metabolic decline and increased inflammation throughout the body. Emerging evidence shows that neuroinflammation has major roles in pathogenesis of AD. In this supplement, we aim to study the role of GHS-R in metabolic reprogramming of microglia in AD. This supplement provides a new immuno-metabolic angle to the AD field, shedding light on a novel role of GHS-R in AD. We believe that this supplement is within the general scope of the funded R01, but expands into an exciting new aspect of AD which is both complementary and synergistic with the NIA funded grant.  Scope of the supplement: We have reported that global ablation of GHS-R improves aging metabolism and mitigates systemic inflammation in aging, showing anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization. Microglia are the primary drivers of neuroinflammation, our preliminary data showed that GHS-R expression in microglia is drastically increased by AD-priming endotoxin lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and GHS-R antagonist suppresses LPS-induced inflammation in macroglia. We hypothesize that GHS-R is a pathogenic factor for AD; GHS-R promotes pro- inflammatory activation and polarization of microglia to exacerbate neuroinflammation in AD. We will study microglial GHS-R deficient 5XFAD mice (Cx3cr1CreER;Ghsrflox\\/flox; 5XFAD) via the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Determine the role of microglial GHS-R on learning and memory, neuroinflammation, and AD pathology. Aim 2. Determine the polarization state, cellular\\/molecular signatures, and regulatory mechanisms of GHS-R deficient microglia in AD.  The impact of the supplement: This supplemental funding will provide us with the much- needed support to investigate our new hypothesis. Our unique mouse model and solid preliminary data combined with our expertise in immunology and aging metabolism offer strong scientific premise and high feasibility for success. We are confident that we will successfully complete the proposed studies with the support of the award. Results from current proposal will set the stage for a full-fledged project in further mechanistic investigation of nutrient\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009csensing GHS-R in AD, which has potential to lead to novel immunotherapeutic interventions for AD. -- Project Narrative Neuroinflammation plays an important role in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We observed that inactivation of ghrelin receptor GHS-R in myeloid cells suppresses neuroinflammation and improves cognitive function under diet-induced obesity. The goal of this proposal is to determine the direct effect of GHS-R in microglia under AD and interrogate GHS-R associated cellular\\/molecular mechanims in microglial polarization.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Abstract This administrative supplement proposal is submitted in response to NOSI NOT-AG-20-034 to add Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s-relevant studies to the PIs\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2 parent proposal \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c5\\u0093Causes of Immune Cell Senescence in Aging Humans.\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d The parent grant was designed to test the hypothesis that aging causes various subsets of human circulating immune cells to increasingly undergo telomere dysfunction-induced cellular senescence with advancing age, thereby resulting in an age-associated dysregulation of immune cell function. Preliminary data included in the original proposal revealed a dramatic and significant increase in the percentages of senescent CD8+ T cells with advanced age, ranging from about 24% in people\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s 20s to levels of about 65% by the time they reach their 60s, but with a range of senescent cells across different donors. The active grant does not include any research questions relating to Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease (AD). As such, without changing the aims of the parent grant, we seek supplemental funding for additional methods and participant recruitment to address the possibility that, among the healthy older participants recruited, some may have higher genetic risk for AD, and possibly be in the earliest stages of preclinical AD, despite presenting with no readily-apparent cognitive deficits. This is a significant concern because there is a growing appreciation that AD involves disruption to the immune system. To address this possibility, we have entered into new collaborations with two teams of well-respected and well-funded AD-researchers.

The large size of Gluck\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s existing cohort allows us to pre-select those individuals with the highest and lowest APOE risk; half of these participants will be pre-selected for high genetic risk for AD (APOE genotypes \\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b54\\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b54, \\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b53\\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b54), with the other half having low genetic risk for AD (APOE genotypes \\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b52\\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b52, \\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b52\\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b53). We will also recruit an additional 16 African- American individuals in their 20\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s and 30\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s as younger controls. A second new set of collaborators, Drs. Blennow and Zetterberg, from the University of Gothenburg, are experts in blood-based biomarkers for early AD; plasma will be sent to these Swedish collaborators where they will assess blood-based AD biomarkers, including P-Tau181. We will carry out measurements of peripheral immune cell senescence in these cohorts as described in the parent grant using flow cytometric, microscopic and genomic analyses. We hypothesize that older participants (ages 60 and above) who are at high APOE-genetic risk for AD will show enhanced levels of senescence in CD8+ T cells and will have enhanced histochemical evidence of telomere dysfunction in their CD8+ T cells as compared to participants who have low APOE-genetic risk for AD, and will have higher levels of P-Tau181. -- Narrative In the parent R21 grant, we have developed a sensitive flow-cytometric marker for senescent white blood cells that accumulate in the blood with aging.

Identifying fundamental cell autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms driving aging and age-related diseases such as AD and devising strategies to therapeutically target them is imperative to alleviate tremendous disease burden and healthcare costs. It is generally accepted that damaged or stressed cells activate a variety of signaling cascades that regulate cell fate decisions, including senescence and apoptosis. These cell autonomous events can lead to impaired tissue homeostasis via loss of functional, terminally-differentiated cells or via loss of regenerative capacity. For example, senescence increases in different cell types in the brains of mouse models of AD and reduction in this senescent cell burden either genetically or pharmacologically improves pathology. There is also strong evidence for cell non-autonomous mechanisms of aging, including data from experiments implementing heterochronic parabiosis2-7, plasma transfer7 and measurement of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) produced by senescent cells8-11.

Ercc1, a gene that encodes one subunit of the DNA repair endonuclease ERCC1-XPF, was deleted in 7 organs or cell types using Cre-lox technology. Loss of Ercc1 expression destabilizes the holoenzyme ERCC1-XPF in vivo12. As a consequence, spontaneous, endogenous DNA damage accumulates more rapidly in tissues of mutant mice compared to wild- type (WT) mice able to repair the damage13. For example, deletion of Ercc1 in pancreatic \\u00c3\\u0083\\u00c5\\u00b8 cells results in a type II diabetes-like condition with evidence of senescence and SASP in fat and liver whereas deletion in podocytes develop chronic kidney disease. Interestingly, deletion of Ercc1 in the hematopoietic compartment using the Vav (HS21\\/45) promoter to drive Cre expression14 potently drove senescence and loss of tissue homeostasis in the immune compartment, but also in multiple solid organs including the brain. Vav-Cre+\\/-;Ercc1-\\/fl mice have premature senescence of immune cells and many characteristics of immunosenescence typical of aged mice and humans15, including impaired immune function. This was accompanied by increased expression of senescence markers p16Ink4a, p21Cip1 and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors in multiple tissues including brain, liver, kidney, lung, GI and aorta.

Our existing R01 does not include any studies involving analysis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patents' genomes. However, such analysis would be within the scope of this R01 because pL1s and their DNA damage are a common theme of both the funded R01 and the proposed Administrative Supplement. The proposed research is important to AD because brains of AD patients have increased levels of DNA breaks compared to age-matched controls with evidence supporting that this damage leads to neuronal loss at the pre-clinical stage of AD when plaques and tangles have not yet been formed. Thus, identification of an additional mechanism(s) underlying neuronal loss will significantly improve our understanding of AD etiology and progress in treatment development. Several molecular mechanisms guard against L1-associated damage. One of them is a TRIM28-mediated suppression of L1 expression by epigenetic silencing of L1 promoters. Although TRIM28 is expressed in neurons throughout the brain, L1 damage occurs in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, which are the areas that are also affected in AD patients. Our preliminary findings show that, independent of its role in suppression of L1 transcription, TRIM28 interacts with L1 proteins and stimulates L1 retrotransposition.  We hypothesize that genomes of AD patients have more pL1s than genomes of normal subjects, which can contribute to the neuronal loss associated with an increase in L1-associated DNA damage, especially when combined with deregulation of TRIM28. We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims. Aim 1 will perform a case-control study to determine the number of pL1s in the genomes of AD patients (case) and age-matched subjects without cognitive impairment (control). This aim will determine whether the number and\\/or composition of pL1s is associated with AD. Aim 2 will determine the mechanism of TRIM28 interaction with L1 ORF2p protein and its effect on L1 integration and DSB-formation. This aim will determine whether TRIM28 plays a dual role in the L1 amplification cycle and the mechanism of TRIM28-associated stimulation of L1 retrotransposition. Combined positive outcomes of these aims would justify large-scale studies testing the utility of genomic L1 content in identifying individual risk of developing AD and\\/or other age-related dementias. -- Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Currently there is no cure or reliable prognostic biomarkers that accurately predict the risk of developing AD.

Background: SENO drugs ameliorate numerous age-related pathologies through a common pharmacological action: the selective killing or alteration of senescent cells. SENO drugs are expected to postpone diverse causes of human mortality including Parkinson\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease, Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease, and atherosclerosis, as well as cancer metastasis and recurrence. We propose to study SENO drugs, targeting three distinct pathways. These pathways lead to alternative responses characterized by distinct levels of AMP Kinase and P53.

The extension is designed to look at the complications of COVID-19 in the presence of cognitive impairment and neuropathological lesions of Alzheimer's disease in an aging mouse model. This is translationally relevant because patients with cognitive impairment related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are at increased risk for complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several factors are involved including cognitive impairment resulting in failure to follow exposure guidelines, such as crowd mingling, hand washing and other decontamination procedures. In addition, many individuals that require various levels of intensive care may come in close contact with others with similar poor health conditions that may be carrying the virus. Lastly, the debilitating effects of AD may inherently increase susceptibility to the severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection known to occur in older frail people. For these reasons, it is critical to investigate the mitigating factors associated with increasing resilience to pathological consequences of infection to prevent increased morbidity and mortality in an already susceptible elderly population. Given that a major risk factor for developing severe and fatal SARS-CoV-2 pathology is aging, it is thus a centerpiece for the geroscience concept that examines the relationship between biological aging and age-related diseases through multiple processes, and that aging intervention requires targeting multiple aging processes. Our parent grant is set up to address this concept for AD. The development of a multidrug cocktail that targets multiple aging processes and increases resilience to AD pathology should, by definition, also increase resilience to SARS-CoV-2 pathology in AD patients. The hypothesis of this supplement proposal is that a drug cocktail of rapamycin, acarbose, and phenylbutyrate, targeting multiple aging processes, will increase resilience to the pathological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in an aging mouse model of AD. Aim 1 will investigate effects of treatment with an anti-aging drug cocktail in AD mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Aim 2 will develop pathology profiles to show that treatment of AD mice with an anti-aging drug cocktail will enhance resilience and improve health by targeting processes of aging and prevent the devastating pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This approach has tremendous clinical health implications for AD patients but perhaps just as important for individuals in the early stage of disease such as mild cognitive impairment. The concept of a drug cocktail that could successfully increase resilience to COVID-19 pathology in Alzheimers disease patients would be expected to have a significant impact on the health of people at increased risk for infection. -- Narrative. The goal of this supplement is to investigate resilience to SARS-CoV-2 pathology in mice with Alzheimers disease using a geroscience approach focused on multiple aging processes. The concept of a drug cocktail targeting aging processes that could successfully increase resilience to COVID-19 pathology in Alzheimers disease patients would be expected to have a significant impact on the health of people at increased risk for infection.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary\\/Abstract of Supplement The risk of protein misfolding diseases increases with age as mechanisms regulating proteostasis begin to fail. Age-associated neurodegenerative disorders are frequently characterized by unfolded proteins and aggregation, as observed in Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Failure to maintain proper protein processing during aging is a major factor in pathology associated with these diseases. In the case of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), disease incidence increases in the presence of mutations in the progranulin gene GRN. All pathological GRN mutations result from reduced expression or function. Thus, methods of increasing GRN expression have the potential to help prevent or delay disease. Dietary restriction (DR) has been shown to improve maintenance of proteostasis and ameliorate disease outcomes in animal models. In preliminary data, we found that DR increases the translational efficiency of the neurotrophic factor GRN\\/pgrn-1. Higher levels of this factor are known to reverse proteotoxicity induced by TDP-43 and amyloid beta aggregates. Similar increases in translational efficiency are observed for FRamide neuropeptides, which are known in mammals to have roles in metabolism and stress response, but for which there is a lack of understanding about how they are regulated. Thus, while the associated parent grant is focused on the effects of DR and DR-associated low translation on body muscle and organismal physiology, this FTD\\/Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s- focused administrative supplement (NOT-AG-20-008) specifically addresses how progranulin and these neurotransmitters are post-transcriptionally regulated under DR and DR-related low translation conditions. As part of our investigation into this form of gene regulation, we will also create new tools to investigate neuroprotection and the contribution of DR-related translational responses. Translation is an understudied area of gene regulation with the potential to yield new insights into neurodegeneration research. These studies will inform more time-consuming studies in mammalian systems and may yield new approaches with therapeutic potential. In addition, this research will lead to new avenues of exploration and will be used to develop future grant applications involving FTD and ADRD studies. -- Public Health Relevance Statement Maintaining proper synthesis and turnover of cellular proteins (i.e., proteostasis) is diminished with age, which impairs healthy tissue function and contributes to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s and related dementias. Certain genetic determinants, including low expression of the neurotrophic factor progranulin, increase the chance for these diseases. The goal of this study is to determine how gene activity for progranulin and other potentially important neuropeptides is increased under dietary restriction, an intervention known to delay or otherwise mitigate diseases involving deficient proteostasis.

We propose using the well-established C. elegans model of AD to interrogate new models of AD pathology. Previously, our lab discovered a critical link for the cytoprotective transcription factors SKN-1 (in worms) and NRF2 (in mammals) for maintaining metabolic homeostasis in a diet-dependent manner. Moreover, we recently published that SKN-1 mediates one of the earliest responses to pathogen exposure. The \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c5\\u0093pathogen hypothesis\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d is an understudied idea that chronic infection by viral, bacterial, and\\/or fungal pathogens can be a potent contributor for sporadic AD onset during aging. In light of the high degree of conservation of SKN-1\\/NRF stress pathway responses in worms, mice, and humans that we have documented, we hypothesize that: (1) SKN-1\\/NRF2 is the central mediator of the \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c5\\u0093pathogen hypothesis\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d models of Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease; and (2) Diet-gene pairs influence AD pathology progression and severity. We focus by on our established gene and diet combinations in the context of well-established AD models as well as new paradigms that integrate pathogen exposure and responses on AD pathology. This project will engage a team of scientists to test novel and easily testable models of the pathogen hypothesis in C. elegans (Aim 1) and the impact of diet on AD markers (Aim 2). Together, this supplement will address the significance of two environmental conditions (pathogen exposure and diet) on established and novel AD models in C. elegans. Capitalizing on the facile genetic and molecular approaches, a sort generation time, and ease of culturing, C. elegans is the ideal model for this one-year administrative supplement project to rapidly acquire large data sets and integrate these findings into new studies of AD pathology in mammals. The results of these efforts will lead to new therapeutic approaches to treat AD. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE New approaches are needed to combat Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease (AD), a neurodegeneration condition that affects millions of people in the United States at an estimated cost exceeding hundreds of billions of dollars. Despite decades of work a treatment does not exist. The need for new research models, that can rapidly test hypotheses and generate data that can inspire next-generation vertebrate models and\\/or the clinic directly is great. Our proposal exploits an invertebrate model and capitalizes on a decade of work to quickly generate innovative systems to combat this debilitating disease.\"},{\"abstract\":\"SUMMARY The cytoskeleton and its connections to the nucleus play fundamental critical roles in establishing cellular morphology, polarity, migration and substrate adhesion. We have discovered a fundamental cell polarity defect that occurs in physiological aging and in children with the accelerated aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. This defect results from imbalanced connections between the nuclear lamina on the inner aspect of the inner nuclear membrane and two major cytoskeletal protein systems: actin\\/microfilaments and microtubules. These connections are mediated by the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex composed of inner nuclear membrane SUN and outer nuclear membrane KASH proteins. In aging, there is a preferential interaction of increased SUN1 with microtubules versus SUN2 with actin\\/microfilaments. The parent funded grant (R01 AG064944) for this supplemental application is designed to test the hypothesis that altered nucleocytoskeletal connections mediated by the LINC complex cause an intrinsic cell polarity defect in aging. In this supplement, we will expand the parent project to examine nucleocytoskeletal connections in Alzheimer disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative dementias. The neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau accumulates in a hyperphosphorylated form in neurons in these disorders and amyloid-beta (A\\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b2) oligomers accumulate extracellularly and induce hyperphosphorylation of tau. We will therefore test the hypothesis that tau and oligomeric A\\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b2 alter microtubule association with LINC complexes and interfere with the generation of cell polarity in a fibroblast model system and in primary neurons. In Aim 1, we will determine if tau and A\\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b2 influence the interactions of microtubules with LINC complexes and alter the generation of cell polarity. To do so, we will use a robust fibroblast model system as proposed in the funded parent award. In Aim 2, we will determine if tau hyperphosphorylation induced by oligomeric A\\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b2 oligomers increases microtubule interactions with the nucleus and perform experiments to establish if these altered interactions underlie concurrent pathological changes in primary neurons. Finally, we will also assess the effects of SUN1 overexpression, which occurs with aging, on primary neurons. This research will implicate tau\\/A\\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b2-induced dysfunction of the LINC complex in the pathogenesis of AD and related dementia, and potentially identify targets for the development of therapeutic treatments. -- NARRATIVE The cytoskeleton is the internal framework of a cell composed of protein filaments that provide structural support and drive movement. This project will expand our research on abnormalities in connections between the cytoskeleton and nucleus that occur in aged cells to cells with changes characteristic of Alzheimer disease and related neurodegenerative dementias. The results could lead to the identify of druggable targets to treat these devastating dementias associated with aging.\"},{\"abstract\":\"7. PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding how human cells organize, shape, and move their membrane-bound organelles is one of the most fundamental problems in biology. To address this challenge, my laboratory studies how the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons control membrane remodeling and organelle dynamics. As cells age, their ability to properly regulate these processes changes. This is especially true for kidney cells and immune cells, as a variety of renal and inflammatory diseases develop with age. However, the differences in cytoskeletal functions that give rise to these cellular changes during the aging process are poorly understood. In human cells, actin filament networks are assembled by proteins called nucleation factors from the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) family. Despite their importance in remodeling membranes during a wide range of processes, these nucleation factors have not been well characterized, especially as they relate to aging and mechanisms of human disease. I have a long-standing interest in determining how the cytoskeleton drives membrane dynamics in normal cells, and how these functions are altered in the context of infectious and genetic diseases. The immediate goal of this Career Development Award is to allow me to initiate another avenue of investigation on the role of the cytoskeleton in cell aging so that I can achieve my long-term goal of leading a lab which studies cytoskeletal functions in health, aging, and disease. These goals will be achieved by completing four specific aims: (1) Define roles for actin nucleation factors and regulators of autophagy in kidney disease, including Nephrocerebellar Syndrome (NCS); (2) Determine functional links between the cytoskeleton, autophagy, cytokine secretion, and inflammation during infection and aging; (3) Deepen my training in the biology of aging through collaborative training experiences at the Jackson Laboratory's Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging and at the Center on Aging at the UConn Health Center; (4) Develop into an independent investigator in the basic biology of cell aging. Given my expertise in cytoskeletal biology, plus my existing grant on the role of actin nucleation in autophagy and disease, my lab is uniquely positioned to provide key mechanistic insights into the relationships among actin nucleation factors, autophagy, kidney function, inflammation, and aging. -- 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The cytoskeleton (\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c5\\u0093cell skeleton\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d) is crucial for shaping and moving our cells and organelles. As cells age, their ability to properly control these processes changes. This is especially true for kidney cells and immune cells, as a variety of renal and inflammatory diseases develop with age. However, the differences in cytoskeletal functions that give rise to these cellular changes during the aging process are poorly understood. We are studying how cytoskeletal proteins allow the normal functioning of our cells, and how their activities are altered in the context of genetic disorders, infectious diseases, and aging-associated conditions. 9.

A decline in proteostasis function is one of the features of aging tissues, particularly of the central nervous system (CNS). Indeed, the aging brain is particularly sensitive to proteotoxic stress, as demonstrated by the high number of age-associated neurodegenerative disorders characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation, including Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease (AD). The regulation of non-cell autonomous proteostasis has recently arisen as a novel mechanism for the modulation of systemic homeostasis in worms and flies, and is postulated to have important organismal effects on metabolism and aging. However, to date, there are no studies addressing the existence and activity of these pathways in mammals, and their potential effects on the aging brain. Transcription Factor E-B (TFEB) is a powerful master transcription factor regulator of proteostasis, integrating autophagy and bioenergetics. We recently derived transgenic mice that moderately overexpress TFEB in skeletal muscle, and discovered that the resulting enhanced skeletal muscle proteostasis function can significantly ameliorate proteotoxicity in the CNS and also improve cognition and memory in aging mice. In this project, we will determine if enhanced skeletal muscle proteostasis is capable of promoting neuroprotection, uncover the mechanistic basis for this effect, develop powerful new models for testing mitophagy\\/autophagy activity in the aging CNS, and determine if soluble factors secreted by muscle (\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c5\\u0093myokines\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d) mediate the beneficial CNS effects in conditional skeletal muscleexpressing TFEB transgenic mice. Identification of pathways regulating cross-talk between skeletal muscle and CNS may yield targets with high therapeutic potential for diseases of the aging CNS. -- Exercise is a powerful behavioral intervention against central nervous system aging and Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease, and plays an essential role in maintaining healthy neurocognitive function and immune metabolism in the aging brain. By observing the effects of exercise, we saw that the effects of this opposes the local deleterious effects of aging on skeletal muscle, reversing age-associated transcriptional and metabolic dysregulation. We hypothesize that the differential expression and secretion of exercise associated circulating factors may underlie responsiveness to the CNS-targeting effects of exercise.\"},{\"abstract\":\"ABSTRACT This application will investigate the novel pathogenic host-bacterial interactions of which microglial-associated neuroinflammatory hallmarks of Late Onset Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease (LOAD) emerges with periodontitis in relation to aging. The emerging evidence indicates that ligation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced by the key periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, with Toll-Like Receptors-2 and -4 may serve as a risk factor for the initiation and\\/or progression of LOAD induced in young wild type mice. However, using the active R01 parent grant, we recently demonstrated that P. gingivalis-LPS\\/TLRs axis is attenuated in relation to aging, suggesting that an alternative pro-inflammatory mechanism may be engaged in the age-dependent pathologies, including LOAD. Our group also found that P. gingivalis produces a novel class of a host cell-membrane permeable ceramide lipid termed phosphoglycerol dihydroceramide (PGDHC) which elevates macrophage activation independently of TLRs. Furthermore, a study demonstrated that among the virulence factors produced by P. gingivalis, only PGDHC is found abundantly in the periodontal lesions as well as in the blood circulation. In addition, our preliminary data show that PGDHC is frequentely detected in the postmortem brains of patients with Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease compared to that in healthy indviduals. Other preliminary results demonstrated that PGDHC elevates periodontal inflammation by acting on lysosomal protease Cathepsin B. Furthermore, it was reported that cathepsin B exacerbated the LOAD-like neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in a mouse model of periodontitis induced by P. gingivalis. Although studies of Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease pathology have predominantly focused on the amyloid-\\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b2 and hyperphosphorylated tau, recent multidisciplinary findings strongly suggest that neuroinflammation associated with aberrant immune responses of the central nervous system (CNS) resident macrophages, microglia, is the third hallmark features of LOAD. However, it remains elusive whether PGDHC can promote microglia activation leading to the LOAD neuroinflammation. Based on these lines of evidence, we hypothesize that, in the context of LOAD-associated neuroinflammation, a novel PGDHC\\/Cathepsin B axis is engaged in the microglial activation. In the course of this one-year pilot study, we will investigate the impact of PGDHC on the cathepsin B-dependent activation of mouse primary microglia cells in vitro as well as the LOAD-like neuroinflammation and memory skills in relation to aging using female and male Cathepsin B-knock out and their wild type mice. Then, we will employ the single cell RNA-seq technology to identify transcriptome profiles between distinct subtypes of microglia isolated from the brains of wild type mice in relation to aging and sex. The proposed research project will, for the first time, establish the possible role of P. gingivalis-derived dihydroceramides in neuroinflammation and will provide a foundation for the development of a novel therapeutic approach for preventing periodontitis-associated cognitive decline in LOAD. -- Narrative Although the emerging concept supports that virulence factors produced by the key periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis may be engaged in the microglial-mediated neuroinflammatory hallmarks of Late Onset Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease (LOAD), the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the aberrant immune responses of microglia remain elusive. We discovered a new class of inflammatory ceramides, phosphoglycerol dihydroceramide (PGDHC) produced by P. gingivalis, that is not only abundantly present in human periodontitis lesions, but also engaged in the promotion of inflammation in a cathepsin B-dependent manner. The proposed studies will investigate the role of cathepsin B in the PGDHC-mediated microglia activation using experimental models of LOAD-like neuroinflammation and single cell RNA-sequencing technology.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY It has been well established that Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease and other dementias are substantially higher in people with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance occurs in almost 80% of people with Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease. Both aerobic exercise and resistance exercise training improve peripheral insulin sensitivity and have a beneficial effect on cognition. Although several studies have shown that aerobic exercise in both animals and humans improves brain glucose uptake and mitochondrial function, it is currently unknown whether resistance exercise has any direct effect on brain biology that can contribute to improved cognitive functions. In the current application, we propose to collect preliminary data to plan future larger studies to test the hypothesis that resistance exercise which improves peripheral insulin sensitivity also increases insulin sensitivity in the brain as measured by 18-FDG PET scanning. In addition, we will determine whether the same areas in the brain showing improved glucose uptake also have evidence of enhanced mitochondrial energy metabolites and other biomarkers of neuronal health. We will use structural MRI as well as phosphorus and proton MR spectroscopy to measure brain microstructure and metabolites in brain regions rich in insulin receptors such as cortex and hippocampus. In addition, we also will measure functional connectivity between different regions of the brain by functional MRI to test a hypothesis that improving insulin sensitivity and enhanced energy metabolism in the brain will improve connectivity between different regions of the brain and that this improved connectivity is related to improvements in cognition. All the techniques proposed in the current study are well established at our institution where the PI collaborated with neuro-radiologists and nuclear medicine experts to perform studies in type 1 diabetes showing that insulin deficiency-related changes on brain energetics and functional connectivity concurrent to cognitive changes. In the current study we propose to measure MRI (structural and functional), MR spectroscopy and 18-FDG PET scans as well as neuropsychological tests using NIH Tool box in 24 insulin resistant participants who are part of an NIH RO1 grant to study the mechanism of resistance exercise training effects on peripheral insulin sensitivity. We propose that this is a very cost-effective approach to obtain currently non-existent preliminary data to move forward with further larger studies to understand how resistance training improves cognition by measuring brain connectivity, energetics, and microstructure. The only additional expenses for this study are related to the neuroradiology involving MR measurements and radioisotope-based glucose uptake studies based on PET scan. The results from this study will allow us to determine whether there is sufficient preliminary data to support our hypothesis that resistance exercise training improves brain functions and cognitive functions in insulin resistant people. -- PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease and related dementias are major emerging public health problems in the United States and the rest of the world. In addition to improving insulin action, resistance exercise programs are also very effective in preventing muscle wasting and weakness in elderly people with type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance. In this proposal we will determine whether resistance exercise training for three months will enhance intellectual function concurrent to improved insulin sensitivity and brain function. The proposed study will collect preliminary data in 24 older participants with insulin resistance from an ongoing NIH-supported study of resistance exercise and the mechanism of insulin sensitivity.\"},{\"abstract\":\"ABSTRACT Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder which has systemic effects. For instance, AD patients generally suffer from low bone mineral density even in early stages of the disease, and as such are more prone to bone fractures relative to the general population. Due to the loss in bone density, autologous bone grafts are generally not an option in fracture repair for the AD patient population. Furthermore, healing of fractures in AD is usually slow and often results in delayed or incomplete healing. This delayed healing is on top of the already high complication rates often associated with defect repair. The loss in bone mineral density in AD appears to be due in part to the abnormal peripheral sympathetic nerve (SN) activation often associated with the disease. Particularly, elevated levels of TNF\\u00c3\\u008e\\u00c2\\u00b1 in the osteoporotic AD bone are correlated with abnormally active SNs, which are known to critically influence bone healing, resorption, vascularization, and homeostasis. Thus, a biomaterial scaffold which stimulates a more normal phenotype in growing SNs may enhance osteogenesis and bone healing in AD fracture repair. Recently, we proposed a new scaffold design based on a novel class of shape memory polymers (SMPs). Avoiding the use of exogenous factors \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009c which can cause undesired off-target effects - these scaffolds provide intrinsic osteoinductivity through the incorporated adhesion ligand(s) and a nanoscale polydopamine coating known to support osteogenesis as well as the formation of hydroxyapatite. Interestingly, polydopamine coatings have also recently been demonstrated to stimulate extension and phenotypic maturation in SN-like cells, as have fibronectin- and laminin-derived integrin adhesion ligands. This R03 proposal focuses on tailoring the integrin adhesion-based landscape of SMP scaffolds to promote desired SN cell and MSC phenotypes within the context of an osteo- and neuro-inductive polydopamine base. This proposal is unique in its focus on tailoring the phenotype of ingrowing SN cells toward improving MSC osteogenesis and doing so within a disease- mimetic \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c5\\u0093inflamed\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00c2\\u009d environment. -- NARRATIVE Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease (AD) patients generally suffer from low bone mineral density even in early stages of the disease, and as such are more prone to bone fractures as well as delayed healing relative to the general population.
