{"body": "[{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARYIn addition to aging, major risk factors for cognitive decline include female gender, stress, and stress-relateddisorders such as depression. Both major depressive disorder (MDD) and dementia are more common inwomen than in men. In this proposal, we aim to investigate the sex and strain-specific epigenetic changesthat parallel cognitive decline in an animal model of increased stress-reactivity and depression-like traits.Through selective and long-term full-sib breeding, we obtained two inbred strains from the parental WistarKyoto (WKY) rat strain: the WKY More Immobile (WMI), and its isogenic control, the WKY Less Immobile(WLI). Compared to WLIs, both male and female WMIs show consistently greater despair-like behavior in theforced swim test. Hippocampus-dependent contextual fear memory did not differ between young WLI andWMI males and females. However, by 12 months of age (middle-age), female WMIs showed a significantdecline in fear memory compared to young WMI females, while no decrease in fear memory was observed infemale WLIs and male WLIs and WMIs. We propose to test the hypothesis that age-induced strain-specificchanges in the hippocampal methylome and transcriptome of female WMIs are associated with the decline intheir fear memory.Aim 1 will evaluate the sex-specific strain differences between young (6 months) and middle-aged (12months) WMI and WLI in the contextual fear conditioning, novel object recognition and Morris water mazeparadigms. Additionally, WMI and WLI males and females will be maintained from 6 to 12 months of age inan enriched environment (EE), that is known to enhance memory, and at 12 months of age tested in the samelearning\\/memory tests. Aim 2 will identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) within differentially methylatedregions using integrative analysis of Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing and RNA-seq betweenadditional groups of young and middle-aged WMI and WLI males and females after being exposed to thecontextual fear conditioning test. Comparisons will be prioritized to those DEGs that differ exclusively betweenWMI females of 6- and 12-months of age. The WMI and WLI genome have been sequenced and will serveas the reference genomes for these analyses. Expression of DEGs within differentially methylated regionswill be measured by quantitative RT-PCR in the hippocampus of young and middle-aged male and femaleWMIs and WLIs with and without enriched environment housing from 6 to 12 months of age (Aim 1) to identifychanges induced by age and EE. Candidate DEGs will also be measured in the hippocampi of all animalsfrom Aim 2, when expression data of DEGs will be associated with contextual fear memory in the sameanimals. Prediction models for memory will be built using the obtained and confirmed DEGs and methylationdata.--PROJECT NARRATIVEBy 2050; people aged 65 and older will make up more than 20 percent of the U.S. population. Age; being female;stress and depression are risk factors to develop dementia and Alzheimer's Disease; but there is limitedknowledge of the mechanism of why these factors convey risk. We will explore the age-related molecularchanges in the brain of male and female animals with increased reactivity to stress; depression-like behaviorand early memory loss; which molecular changes could lead to novel drug targets for dementia; specifically inwomen.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Abstract Postoperative delirium (POD), a condition characterized by a state of confusion, is one of the mostcommon postoperative complications among senior patients and is associated with substantially increasedrates of morbidity and mortality, increased cost of care, and risk of developing Alzheimer?s disease and relateddementias (ADRD). However, even with ongoing POD studies, the pathogenesis of POD is still mostlyunknown, which impedes further studies of POD, including the targeted interventions. Thus, there is notreatment for POD at present. Consistent with the notion that gut microbiota dysbiosis (e.g., gut microbiotacommunity structure changes), neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are part of ADRDneuropathogenesis and are also associated with cognitive impairments, our preliminary studies showed thatthe open abdominal surgery under general anesthesia (anesthesia\\/surgery) induced an age-dependent gutmicrobiota dysbiosis, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and POD-like behavior in the mice. Thus,we will extend these studies to further define a potential multifactorial model of POD pathogenesis by testingthe following hypothesis: anesthesia\\/surgery-induced neuroinflammation (the precipitating factor and thecontributor) is promoted by age-associated microbiota dysbiosis (the predisposing factor and the modulator),leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and POD-like behavior in mice. We will employ biochemical andbehavioral tools to accomplish two Specific Aims: (1) we will assess the effects of anesthesia\\/surgery ongut microbiota and fecal b-amyloid, blood and brain level of IL-6, microglia activation, brain Ab andmitochondrial function, and POD-like behavior in aged mice (18 month-old mice or 3 month-old germ-free micefed with feces of the 18 months old mice) as compared to those in adult mice (9 months old mice or 3 month-old germ-free mice fed with feces of the 9 months old mice); (2) we will assess whether treatment withbutyrate, antibiotic (e.g., cefazolin) and probiotic can mitigate the POD-like behavior and their associatedchanges in feces, blood, and brain in the mice. We will employ an innovative label-free nano-biosensingsystem for biomolecular analysis (nanobeam technology) in the proposed studies. This proposal aims toinvestigate an understudied topic in innovative systems through testing novel hypotheses. These studies couldultimately help to develop the targeted interventions of POD by targeting microbiota dysbiosis. These effortswould ultimately promote safer anesthesia and surgical care, leading to better postoperative outcomes forsenior patients and, consequently, the development of strategies towards preventing ADRD.--Project Narrative Postoperative delirium; the most common postoperative complication among senior patients; is an acutecondition characterized by a state of confusion and is associated with substantially increased rates of morbidityand mortality; cost of care; and risk of developing Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias. However; thepathogenesis of postoperative delirium remains largely unknown. The proposed research will determinewhether the interaction of age-associated gut microbiota with anesthesia\\/surgery-induced neuroinflammationcan contribute to the brain mitochondrial dysfunction and delirium-like behavior in mice; which will ultimatelylead to targeted interventions (e.g.; treatment with probiotics) for the postoperative delirium.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACT Increasing numbers of older adults are undergoing surgery (~37% of all surgeries), with the primary goal ofimproving function and quality of life. However, these surgical procedures increase the risk of developingpostoperative neurocognitive disorders (PND). PND pose a significant public health problem, leading to acascade of deleterious complications, including prolonged intensive care and hospital stay, increased healthcarecosts (~$150 billion\\/year), reduced patients? function, and are independently associated with subsequentcognitive impairment and ultimately dementia. Older adults are particularly at-risk of developing PND both in theshort and long term. Although age is consistently reported as an important risk factor, the exact pathophysiologyof PND remains poorly understood, but may include postsurgery-compromised blood brain barrier (BBB)function. Surgery can disrupt the BBB function via the release of inflammatory mediators that facilitate migrationof macrophages and pro-inflammatory cytokines into brain regions. However, clinical reports of links betweenPND and BBB function, and brain tissue, are scarce and small in number. This project proposes thatperioperative BBB disfunction is associated with measurable brain morphologic findings in cognitive controlareas that can be discovered with non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging. Patients scheduled for surgerywith an age range of 65-75 years of age, will participate in brain diffusion-weighted pseudo-continuous arterialspin labeling and diffusion tensor imaging, cognitive assessment, and evaluation of a BBB marker from blood (atbaseline, at two weeks, and at six months after surgery). The specific aims are to: 1) examine BBB function,using diffusion-weighted pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling procedures, and BBB marker from blood(S100? levels); 2) assess brain tissue changes, using diffusion tensor imaging-based mean diffusivity measures,and cognition function; 3) examine the relationships between BBB blood biomarker, BBB function index, andmean diffusivity values in cognitive control areas (prefrontal cortex, caudate, and hippocampus). In summary, the overall purpose of this study is to examine the potential mechanisms contributing to PND inan older surgical population, with the hypothesis that BBB will be altered, contributing to brain tissue changes incognitive control areas, reflected as PND. The proposed study has the potential to dramatically impact clinicalpractice, benefiting not only older adults undergoing surgery, but also the general surgical population. Thesuccessful completion will advance understanding of how surgery affects the blood-brain barrier interface, andwill provide new mechanisms of relevance to PND, neurodegeneration, and aging. This study will expand currentscientific understanding of PND and provide critical pilot data for future intervention-based studies that canfurther the development of preventive measures, improving patient outcomes, and greatly impacting the qualityof life for millions of older patients in the United States.--PROJECT NARRATIVE Millions of older Americans require common surgical interventions; placing them at risk for developingdevastating postoperative neurocognitive disorders. However; the exact pathophysiology of postoperativeneurocognitive disorders remains poorly understood; but may include compromised blood brain barrier functioninduced brain changes. We will examine the potential mechanisms of brain injury contributing to postoperativeneurocognitive disorders opening up groundbreaking avenues for future interventions that identify; prevent; andtreat these diseases; and thus; reduce morbidity and mortality in older surgical patients.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACTChronic kidney disease (CKD) is largely an age-related clinical disorder with accelerated cognitive andcardiovascular aging. Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent in CKD affecting 20-50% of patients aged 50 orolder with CKD stage 3-4. Cognitive function worsens as kidney function declines. Cognitive impairment inCKD results in increased mortality, functional decline, depression and reduced quality of life. Metabolicacidosis is a common complication of CKD as the diseased kidney is unable to excrete the daily dietary acidload. Metabolic acidosis is strongly linked to risks of cardiovascular disease, CKD progression, cognitivedysfunction and death. Metabolic acidosis results in increased production of angiotensin II, endothelin-1 andaldosterone in order to enhance urinary acid excretion. All three of these humoral factors are significantcontributors to vascular dysfunction of the peripheral circulation causing blood flow to be delivered to the brainin a higher pulsatile manner. These abnormalities cause damage of small cerebral vessels creating a vascularpathway to cognitive impairment and dementia in midlife and older adults with kidney disease. In ourpreliminary data, we show that treatment of metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate therapy improves peripheralvascular dysfunction and we demonstrate that metabolic acidosis is associated with cognitive impairment in2853 older hypertensive participants with and without CKD. Whether alkali therapy improves cognitive functionor cerebrovascular function is unknown and are the aims of the current study. We are proposing a pilot,randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 12-month trial of 50 patients, 50-75 years of age with CKDstage 3b-4 with metabolic acidosis to examine the effect of sodium bicarbonate therapy on cognitive andcerebrovascular function. Our overall hypothesis is that treatment of metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate willimprove cognitive and cerebrovascular function in patients with CKD stage 3b-4. In Aim 1, we will comparechanges over time in cognitive function using the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery Test and the Trail Making Testbefore and after 12 months of sodium bicarbonate therapy or placebo. In Aim 2, we will compare changes overtime in cerebrovascular reactivity and pulsatility index of the middle cerebral artery using Transcranial DopplerUltrasound before and after 12 months of sodium bicarbonate therapy or placebo. In Aim 3, we will comparechanges over time in humoral mediators of urinary acid excretion that promote vascular endothelial dysfunctionand stiffness (angiotensin II, endothelin-1 and aldosterone) before and after 12 months of sodium bicarbonatetherapy or placebo. The results of this novel pilot study will inform the design of a larger randomized controlledtrial examining the effect of alkali therapy on cognitive and cerebrovascular function and structure in midlifeand older adults with CKD. This proposal represents the critical first step to establish the efficacy ofbicarbonate administration as an inexpensive and easy to administer option for the treatment of cognitiveimpairment and cerebrovascular dysfunction in midlife and older patients with CKD stage 3b-4.--PROJECT NARRATIVECognitive impairment is highly prevalent in midlife and older adults (50-75 years) with chronic kidney disease.Acid retention is a common complication of chronic kidney disease and is strongly associated with increasedrisks of cardiovascular disease; cognitive impairment and death. The current proposal will investigate whethersodium bicarbonate therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease will improve cognitive function and thehealth and function of cerebral arteries. Overall; the proposed research will provide important new scientificevidence upon which physicians can base recommendations to midlife and older adults with chronic kidneydisease to decrease the risk of developing cognitive impairment.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARYThrombectomy has significantly improved stroke outcomes. Nearly 80% of our clinic population now presentwith small strokes and low NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores. However, despite ?good recoveries?, greater than40% endorse significant problems with concentration, attention, executive function, processing speed, andmood during the subacute phase of recovery. This dysfunction prohibits individuals from fully reintegrating intotheir prior home and workplace environments and can result in early retirement or loss of independence,particularly in the older population. Some degree of recovery is observed by 6 months, but it is oftenincomplete or too late to reverse prior life-altering decisions. The impaired executive function and processingspeed appear to occur independent of stroke size, location, or co-existing depression.Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a functional imaging tool able to evaluate neurophysiologic processes inreal time similar to EEG, but with better spatial resolution. Our prior work with MEG suggests that cerebralactivation patterns are not only slowed and more dispersed during task completion in individuals with minorstroke compared to controls, but that there is abnormal activity in the frontal lobes, even at rest. Unfortunately,many patients do not qualify for rehabilitation and there is little data regarding effective treatment options tohasten or augment recovery.Mindfulness training may provide an attractive therapeutic option. A combination of meditation, bodyawareness, and yoga, Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an active process thought to engagethe frontal lobes. MBSR has been shown to improve anxiety and depression in patients with chronic diseasestates like migraine and diabetes, and has also been evaluated in a small series of patients with chronic strokeand traumatic brain injury demonstrating improved performance during tasks of executive function.We propose to study the effect of MBSR in the early phase of stroke recovery to determine if this interventioncan help to prevent post-stroke morbidity. A cohort of 40 patients (NIHSS &lt;8, mRS 0-2) will be enrolled.Twenty will be randomized to a standard 8 week course of MBSR, while the control group will insteadparticipate in a weekly Stroke Support Group (SSG). Depression, cognition, patient perception of recovery, anddegree of re-integration into prior environments will be evaluated pre- and post-intervention to determine theimpact of mindfulness training on subacute post-stroke depression (Aim 3) and cognition (Aim 2). Allparticipants will undergo neuroimaging using MEG pre- and post-intervention to determine theneurophysiologic effect of treatment (Aim 1).Patients with minor stroke have tremendous potential to return to their prior level of function; however, manyfail to return to work or successfully reintegrate into society. MBSR would provide a novel, non-pharmacologictreatment that is likely to be effective by targeting areas of abnormality confirmed by neuroimaging studies.--NARRATIVEWe don't fully understand how; regardless of their size or location in the brain; minor strokes can result insignificant problems with focus; attention; and multi-tasking that prevent individuals from returning to an activelifestyle; and negatively impact quality of life; but our preliminary data using magnetoencephalography (MEG)suggest that there may be disruption of the neuronal network and abnormal frontal lobe activity in the brainafter stroke. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is effective at treating frontal lobe dysfunction in the form of anxiety and depression occurring during the chronic phase of stroke recovery. The aim of this study isto use MBSR to improve other forms of frontal lobe dysfunction (cognitive outcomes) during the subacutephase of recovery; when patients are making critical decisions regarding their ability to return to work or liveindependently; and to use MEG; a tool capable of imaging brain activity and neuronal networks; to understand the brain changes that correspond to improvement after treatment.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARYIn women, reproductive aging is marked by a dramatic decline in ovarian hormone production, and is a timewhen many women report changes in memory and attention. Animal studies provide powerful evidence thatovarian hormones, in particular 17?-estradiol, play a critical role in shaping the morphology and function ofbrain regions that are central to higher order cognitive processes and cognitive aging. The degree to whichfemale reproductive aging leads to macrostructural changes in human brain morphology, changes in brainconnectivity, and ultimately changes in cognitive functioning represents a significant knowledge gap that hasyet to be adequately examined. Ovarian hormone suppression (OHS), a widely used treatment forendometriosis, offers a unique clinical scenario through which to study the impact of estrogen andprogesterone changes on the brain and cognition. The treatment allows for the temporary and reversibleinduction of a postmenopausal-like endocrine status, the effects of which can be observed over the course of afew months, and offers a human analogue of animal studies that have provided substantial evidence for theneuroprotective effects of ovarian hormones and their influence on neural function. In the proposedobservational study, we will examine 200 adult women with endometriosis (ages 25 to 40), half of whom willundergo OHS via the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist Elagolix, and half of whom will followa non-hormonal treatment plan, in order to gain critical insights into how the depletion of ovarian hormonesimpacts the brain and cognition. Women will be examined pre-treatment and at 6 months post-baseline tocharacterize the progression of changes in response to OHS. In Aim 1, we will characterize the effects of OHSon cognitive functioning. We will employ a comprehensive neuropsychological battery to assess changes incognition brought on by OHS. In Aim 2, we will utilize state-of-the-field neuroimaging techniques tocharacterize the impact of OHS on structural brain measures, specifically targeting subfields of thehippocampus, the entorhinal cortex, and white matter pathways using diffusion spectrum imaging. In Aim 3,we will use resting state and task-based fMRI paradigms to determine the effects of OHS on global andregional brain networks. We hypothesize that OHS will impact intrinsic correlations in the default mode,frontoparietal, and limbic networks at rest, and alter prefrontal cortex efficiency during working memory.Finally, in Aim 4, we will test whether polygenic risk for Alzheimer?s disease modifies the effects of OHS on thebrain and cognition. The multimodal cognitive neuroscience approach will allows us to model a core aspect ofreproductive aging, ovarian hormone depletion, while holding chronological age relatively fixed. This projectwill clarify the role of ovarian hormones in shaping brain architecture and cognitive functioning, a severelyunderstudied arena in cognitive neuroscience with clear implications for women?s health.--PROJECT NARRATIVEThe degree to which female reproductive aging leads to macrostructural changes in brain morphology; brainconnectivity; and ultimately cognitive functioning is severely understudied. By examining cognitively normalwomen undergoing ovarian hormone suppression for endometriosis; the present study will model a core aspectof reproductive aging; providing critical insights into how the depletion of ovarian hormones impacts the brainand cognition. This unique; genetically informed; cognitive neuroscience approach will advance our knowledgeof the endocrine basis of cognition and facilitate a targeted approach to identifying individuals who may beparticularly vulnerable to neural and cognitive effects of ovarian hormone depletion.\"},{\"abstract\":\"ABSTRACTFrontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a common neurodegenerative cause of early age-of-onset dementia. Thebehavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD) results in profound changes in personality, as well as social and emotionalfunctioning. Diagnostic uncertainty remains a common concern in bvFTD in spite of improved diagnosticcriteria that focus on particular behavioral and cognitive features accompanied by characteristic neuroimagingpatterns. Accurate diagnoses at the first visit are especially challenging, when cognitive impairment can bemild and functional abilities are more preserved. Other dementia syndromes can mimic features of bvFTD andthere is partial overlap with the symptoms of psychiatric illnesses. With the clarity provided by longitudinalfollow-up clinicians sometimes change bvFTD diagnoses. There are over 15 potential neuropathologicaldiagnoses that underlie bvFTD. Even when a bvFTD diagnosis is clear it is challenging to predict the specificmolecular subtype causing an individual patient?s symptoms. There is substantial heterogeneity in the clinicalcourse in bvFTD as well, with some declining rapidly within 2-3 years and others surviving over more than adecade. Motor features may be present or absent, and their severity in the context of bvFTD can impact thelevel of care a patient requires. There are few reliable indicators to prognosticate a patient?s disease course.The proposed research will study 60 patients with bvFTD longitudinally with neurological examinations,cognitive testing, and structural and functional neuroimaging, and will retrospectively review the clinicalfeatures of 284 autopsied patients with bvFTD. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that in spite of thesimilarities between patients with bvFTD there will be clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, serummarker, genetic, and gene expression differences that permit improved predictive certainty at the first visit. InAim 1 we will use longitudinal assessment of diagnostic stability in order to determine factors that predictcertainty in the bvFTD diagnosis. In Aim 2 we will identify clinical, gene expression, and imaging profiles in acohort of autopsied patients with bvFTD that allow accurate prediction of a patient?s pathological diagnosis. InAim 3 we will use longitudinal data on patients with bvFTD to determine factors that allow accurateprognostication of the clinical course. The results of the proposed research will provide guidance to clinicianswho are considering a diagnosis of bvFTD and will improve the diagnostic and prognostic information availableto patients, families, and clinicians, leading to improved clinical care from the time of the first visit. It will alsofacilitate enrollment of patients into observational research and molecularly targeted clinical trials.--PROJECT NARRATIVEDiagnostic pitfalls and clinicopathological heterogeneity limit the certainty of prognostication for patients withthe behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). The focus of this project is to identify patterns ofclinical features in patients at their first visit that increase certainty in the clinical diagnosis; prediction of theunderlying pathological diagnosis; and precision of prognosis.

Dr. Pasquini is an early-career neuroscientist investigating the neural systems underlyingsocioemotional symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases. Dr. Pasquini has a strong background inneuroscience, clinical neuroimaging, and machine-learning techniques, but he requires mentored research andhigh-level training in four different areas to become established as an independent investigator. The training andresearch program outlined in this proposal will provide Dr. Pasquini with the support necessary to accomplishthe following goals: 1) gain extended expertize in the clinical manifestation of socioemotional symptoms amongelderly populations; 2) achieve proficiency in analysis of multimodal dynamic systems through the application ofcutting-edge machine-learning algorithms; 3) get proficiency in the analysis of autonomic physiologicalrecordings; and 4) develop an independent research career niche based on scientific productivity and grantapplications. To achieve these goals, Dr. Pasquini has assembled a mentorship team including a primary mentor,Dr. William Seeley, a behavioral neurologist with deep expertize in neuroanatomy and neuroimaging ofneurodegenerative diseases; a co-mentor, Dr. Virginia Sturm, a clinical psychologist who investigates autonomicand socioemotional deficits across distinct dementia syndromes; a second co-mentor, Dr. Manish Saggar, acomputational neuroscientist developing computational methods to map dynamic brain activity in healthy andpsychiatric populations; and a significant contributor, Dr. Isabel Allen, a statistician expert in machine-learning.This proposal describes the application of innovative techniques that aim to elucidate how the autonomic systemand the brain dynamically interact to shape emotions and social behavior in healthy controls and patients withneurodegenerative syndromes. By leveraging the neuroanatomical and autonomic deficits found in behavioralvariant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Dr. Pasquini seeks to identify the fundamental properties of neuralsystems underlying socioemotional well-being, with important implications for psychiatry where the neurobiologyunderlying affective disorders is not well understood. Dr. Pasquini will first delineate deficits in dynamic brainnetwork organization in patients with bvFTD and explore the relationship to socioemotional symptoms (Aim 1).Dr. Pasquini will proceed by identifying deficits in dynamic autonomic outflow in patients with bvFTD and assessthe neural correlates through separately acquired neuroimaging (Aim 2). Finally, Dr. Pasquini will capitalize onmultimodal simultaneous acquisitions of autonomic outflow and brain network imaging acquired in healthy oldercontrols to explore how both systems dynamically interact to sustain human emotions and social behavior(Exploratory Aim 3).

Peoplewith Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are at especially high risk for delirium. Thepathophysiology of delirium is not well understood, but is thought to include neuroinflammation and brainenergetic disruption. These features also link delirium to ADRD. Impaired cerebral glucose metabolism is achronic feature of ADRD, and an acute feature of delirium. Similarly, chronic neuroinflammation is thought tobe an important contributor to ADRD, and acute inflammation is associated with delirium. In this translationalproject we propose to test an innovative molecular link between acute-on-chronic brain inflammation andmetabolic dysfunction, using cell systems, mouse models, and biospecimens from a human delirium cohort. Ketone bodies provide a non-glucose energy source for the brain during fasting, and ketone bodymetabolism remains intact in ADRD even with impaired glucose metabolism. We recently found that disruptedglucose metabolism is an important driver of behavioral changes in mouse models of delirium. We alsorecently showed that a ketogenic diet improves memory in both aging mice and an ADRD mouse model. Wedeveloped an innovative toolkit of compounds and genetic models to mechanistically study ketone bodiesexperimentally. We hypothesize that energetic support from ketone bodies might help compensate forinflammation-induced neuronal impairments in glucose metabolism. We also elucidated a new mechanismlinking inflammation to metabolism, showing that activation of peripheral macrophages induces enzymes thatdegrade the key metabolic mediator NAD+. Inflammation-driven NAD+ depletion occurs chronically in aging andADRD, and may occur acutely in delirium. We will use an inflammation model of delirium with normal mice and two ADRD models to test if ketonebodies or NAD+ can rescue acute delirium-like behavioral changes, and identify the relevant mechanisms (Aim1). We will use cultured cells and an in vivo brain inflammation model to determine if activated microgliadeplete NAD+ similarly to macrophages, and whether preventing this also rescues delirium-like behaviors (Aim2). Finally, we will use cerebrospinal fluid samples from a large clinical study of postoperative delirium todetermine how endogenous ketone body and NAD+ levels differ between patients with vs. without delirium(Aim 3). This collaborative project links basic science expertise in ketone body and NAD+ biology relevant toADRD, with basic and clinical research expertise in delirium. It will open a new area of mechanistic study oninflammation-induced metabolic deficits in delirium, guiding development of translational interventions.--PROJECT NARRATIVEDelirium is a devasting acute confusional state that is common in older adults after surgery or in the hospital;especially with Alzheimer's disease.

The prevalence of postoperative delirium depends on type ofsurgery, but an overall postoperative incidence of 17% is a reasonable estimate. The pathophysiologicalmechanisms that underpin postoperative delirium and its sequelae have yet to be systematically studied. Certainpathways may account for the development of delirium itself, while others may drive longer-term cognitiveoutcomes such as progression of dementia. The degree to which these interrelate, are separate or shared iscompletely unknown. One approach to investigate the neural basis of delirium has been to use CSF samplesobtained through regional anesthesia. We propose investigating the neural basis of delirium by using CSFsamples obtained in the course of spinal anesthesia, combining biomarkers with clinical and demographicinformation. Our preliminary data indicates arginine metabolism may be a predictor of delirium in CSF. In thisstudy we aim to extend on our previous work, and accurately quantify all arginine related metabolites andcomplement this data set with protein expression levels for this metabolic cascade. Our goal is to develop acomprehensive picture of arginine metabolism in CSF and correlate these results with current pathophysiologicalbiomarkers of Alzheimer?s disease. Further, having extended our biochemical coverage of arginine metabolism,we will develop novel biomarkers capable of predicting those patients at greatest risk of developing delirium andsubsequent cognitive decline. Having defined the biochemical signature of delirium, it will be important todetermine which patients later developed dementia and\\/or significant neurodegeneration following surgery.Therefore, we will complete a long term follow up of our original patients to determine who developed Alzheimer?sdisease or one of its related dementias and correlate those findings with our results. Moreover, and to ensurethe validity of our delirium biomarker panel, we will prospectively recruit participants undergoing planned jointreplacement surgery at Beaumont Health (>4,000 at Beaumont Royal Oak, 2018), perform pre-operative clinicaland cognitive assessments and postoperative delirium screening. Having access to such a large and diversepatient population will provide the us with an optimal, independent validation set. In summary, our overarchinggoals for this proposal are to: (i) develop an existing collaboration with the largest CSF-delirium repository todate (n=358) in order to extend on current findings; (ii) develop new biomarker panels; (iii) perform a long termfollow up of our initial cohort and (iv) validate our findings in a large and diverse US based population.--Project Narrative: As metabolism is at the core of physiology; metabolomics and proteomics are the idealplatforms to characterize an integrated view of failures in arginine metabolism in people who develop deliriumfollowing elective surgery. Of these patients; ~17% are at greater risk of developing Alzheimer?s disease or oneof its related dementias (ADRD); equating to ~170k people in the US in 2018. Such information could providetotally novel insights about disease mechanisms and progression; providing a biochemical roadmap for noveltreatment development. Further; we aim to develop and fully validate a CSF based test to predict those peopleat greatest risk of developing delirium and subsequently ADRD. In this application; we enrich our efforts bybringing together world experts in metabolomics; delirium; and molecular modelling to build an atlas for aberrantarginine metabolism in delirium sufferers while developing predictive tests for those at greatest risk.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Summary: Post-operative neurocognitive disorder is common after all forms of surgery in older adults. Themechanisms are multifactorial, and probably require pre-existing neuropathology, whether symptomatic ornot. Preclinical and human CSF studies suggests that anesthesia and surgery elicits an increment in CNStauopathy, which may accelerate any pre-existing neuropathology and produce a risk of delirium and thecommonly reported changes in cognition. We here propose an observational clinical study at two sites todetermine whether pre-operative CNS tauopathy as reflected by PET imaging predicts delirium and othercognitive and functional outcomes. This is important since these outcomes may also predict AlzheimerDisease and other dementias. Further, we will determine if anesthesia and spine surgery produces achange in brain tau burden in older adults, as compared to control, non-operative patients. We will alsomeasure pre- and post-surgery blood biomarkers of inflammation, as well as cognitive status using detailedneuropsychological tests. The primary aims of this phased study is to first establish an integrated team,infrastructure and provide preliminary data supporting feasibility, and then to embark on a two-siteobservational study in approximately 30 patients and 30 controls to address the above goals.--Narrative: Older patients frequently experience delirium and report cognitive concerns after surgery. Whichpatients are most vulnerable and why is not yet fully understood; making it difficult to properly informedpatients of their risk for this complication. This clinical project will employ brain imaging and cognitive teststo determine who is most vulnerable; and what the probable causes of post-operative cognitive impairmentare.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARYPerioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNCD) affect about 25% of patients in the periodfollowing surgery, and can persist for months or years in 10% of geriatric surgical patients. Thepresence of acute cognitive disturbances post-surgery increases the risk of patients eventuallydeveloping dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. Poor cognitive outcomes lead to longerhospital stays, decreased quality of life, and increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately,about half of elderly individuals require a surgical procedure at some time in their remainingyears, and no interventions exist to prevent PNCD because the etiology is unclear. One of themain challenges in identifying the factors leading to chronic cognitive impairment is the lack ofroutine, comprehensive cognitive testing in the surgical care plan. This shortcoming is in partdue to the lack of mobile, easy-to-use cognitive testing platforms. To establish the perioperativebiomarkers contributing to cognitive decline, we will (1) integrate routine, comprehensivecognitive testing pre- and post-surgery, and (2) build a database and an analysis platform tomine this multidimensional dataset. Together, this aims to yield accurate models to pre-identifypatients at risk and create targeted therapeutic interventions.We propose to build the foundational infrastructure for a precision medicine approach ingeriatric surgical patients. In the R21 phase, we will build a novel comprehensive database ofdemographic and risk factor questionnaire responses, banked blood specimens, intraoperativeelectroencephalography (EEG), and inclusive cognitive testing. These data will be collectedthroughout the patient interaction, from the preoperative appointment through a year followingthe surgical procedure and available to other research teams. We will incorporate cognitivetesting and collect large-scale data in the geriatric surgical setting, establishing a new precedentfor subsequent multidisciplinary studies. This structure will afford us the opportunity toaccurately track cognitive decline towards chronic conditions, such as dementia.In the R33 phase, we will develop an analysis platform capable of mining this multidimensionaldataset. This phase will include EEG analysis and deep immune profiling using mass cytometry.Layered on these analyses we will build innovative machine learning tools to identify featuresand interactions contributing to both acute and chronic PNCD pathology. Our novel machinelearning tools use prior knowledge to refine feature selection, thus addressing a commonchallenge faced by clinical research studies (having many measurements in a limited patientpopulation), and will thus be of broad interest to other clinical research projects.--PROJECT NARRATIVEPerioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNCD) affect about a quarter of geriatric surgicalpatients and increases the risk that those patients will go on to develop dementias such asAlzheimer's disease. However; no interventions exist to prevent PNCD; mostly because theetiology is unclear. We propose to build the foundation for a precision medicine approach forgeriatric surgical patients who require surgery with anesthesia ? this includes construction of anovel comprehensive database and an analysis platform capable of mining thismultidimensional dataset.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACT Anxiety is a highly prevalent and burdensome symptom of Alzheimer disease (AD), especially at early stages, and is linked to faster decline. Further mechanistic understanding would improve current treatments, which are suboptimal and\\/or carry significant side effects. Yet, the pathophysiology of anxiety in AD is unclear. The CA1 region of ventral hippocampus (vCA1), and specifically its deep pyramidal neurons (dPNs), may play a significant role in anxiogenesis in AD. The vCA1 dPNs are known to increase their activity during anxious behavior and project to other areas of the broad anxiogenic network, including amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus. In addition, compared to dorsal CA1, vCA1 features more intrinsic and synaptic excitability at baseline and appears to be more vulnerable to early AD. Here, our objective is to obtain a cell type-specific understanding of how AD affects ventral CA1 in order to better understand anxiogenesis in AD. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that anxiety in AD relates to hyperexcitability of the vCA1 dPNs. This hypothesis is bolstered by the above, and published and preliminary work suggesting vulnerability of vCA1 in AD-related anxiety and that, in AD, dPNs are prone to intrinsic hyperexcitability and excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. Using the 3xTg-AD mouse model, we test our central hypothesis with the following aims. In Aim 1, we use in vitro electrophysiology and retrograde labeling to elucidate AD-related alterations in synaptic and intrinsic excitability in vCA1 dPNs defined by their projection area. In Aim 2, we use implantable microendoscope imaging of GCaMP calcium signals, c-fos immunohistochemistry, and retrograde labeling to determine the in vivo activity of vCA1 dPNs and projection-defined dPN subpopulations during anxious behavior in AD mice. This work will provide two major results that will significantly add to the understanding of anxiety in AD, at the level of circuit architecture and population coding. Our strategy is conceptually and technically innovative by leveraging cell type-specific circuit knowledge and state-of-the-art approaches to address disease pathophysiology at a cellular level. In supporting our hypothesis, these experiments will determine which vCA1 dPN subpopulations and what excitability mechanisms would be the focus of future work. More generally, these results will further a cell type-specific understanding of AD changes in ventral hippocampus, a structure that has received less attention in mechanistic studies, is highly vulnerable to AD, and is important for not only anxiety but also social and motivational behaviors.--PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is clinically important by focusing on neural circuits that may be important for eliciting anxiety in Alzheimer disease (AD). By examining biological changes in these circuits at multiple levels, in vitro and in vivo, the results of this work will provide a more sophisticated understanding of disease pathophysiology in this region. This will enable novel strategies to improve anxiety in human AD patients.\"},{\"abstract\":\"ABSTRACTThere is increasing evidence that sarcopenia is a risk factor for Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias(ADRD), but the potential mechanisms are unknown. The significance of this gap was highlighted at the 2019NIA-sponsored U13 Osteoporosis & Soft Tissue Disorders Conference where improved understanding of therelationship of skeletal muscle and cognitive impairment was identified as a priority. As recently updated by theEuropean Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP), sarcopenia is defined as the aging-related accumulation of adverse muscle changes that culminates in muscle failure and is best characterized bypoor muscle strength. Age-related sarcopenia and ADRD may be mechanistically linked by dysregulatedkynurenine metabolism in skeletal muscle. Kynurenines are tryptophan metabolites with neurotoxic orneuroprotective effects. Activity-induced skeletal muscle contraction may protect against ADRD by decreasingaccumulation of neurotoxic kynurenines in the brain, with effects regulated by activity-induced musclecontractions.In this study, I propose to measure plasma concentrations of kynurenine metabolites in a community-dwellingolder adults to determine the relationship between physical activity, skeletal muscle strength, andneurocognitive outcomes at baseline and after two years. My central hypothesis is that physical inactivity leadsto skeletal muscle alterations and sarcopenia, characterized functionally by poor muscle strength andmolecularly by accumulation of neurotoxic kynurenines. Accumulation of neurotoxic kynurenines increasesADRD risk, which is reflected by greater concentrations of plasma neurofilament light (NfL) ? a biomarker ofneurodegeneration ? and poorer cognitive performance. If the relationship between physical activity, skeletalmuscle strength, and cognitive performance is mediated by neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites, that will supportfurther studies investigating therapies directed to skeletal muscle to treat ADRD. Fortunately, I have theunique opportunity to address this research question by leveraging an existing cohort of older adults withbaseline and two-year observational measures of actigraphy-based physical activity, physical performance,and cognition as well as plasma available for kynurenine determination.The goal of this project is closely aligned with the GEMSSTAR objective to support junior physician-scientistsbridging geriatrics and medical subspecialties ? in this case, neurology and neuropsychology ? to becomefuture leaders in aging research. Completion of these aims will support my professional developmentobjectives, outlined within this GEMSSTAR application, by developing cross-specialty expertise in twocommon, co-occurring geriatric syndromes: sarcopenia and ADRD. I will develop expertise in the selection,use, and analysis of neuropsychological assessments and refine my neuroscience mentoring and collaborativenetworks. Results of this work will serve as preliminary data for a subsequent career development award toevaluate whether interventions that promote neuroprotective metabolites have beneficial effects on cognitivefunction and ADRD biomarkers. Taken together, this project and GEMSSTAR support will be critical infurthering my development at as transdisciplinary leader in aging-research.--RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTHCurrently there are no effective preventative or disease-modifying treatment for age-related cognitiveimpairment and Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias. Americans aged 80 and above are the fastestgrowing segment of the population and nearly 50% are estimated to have some form of cognitive impairment.There is an urgent need to identify alternative approaches to prevent and treat dementia. There is evidencethat skeletal muscle health is important for brain health. However; it is not known how skeletal muscle andbrain health are linked. In this study; I propose to determine whether healthy skeletal muscle supports brainhealth by detoxifying metabolites made from the amino acid tryptophan that have been shown to be harmful tothe brain. This could help lead to preventative therapies or treatments for dementia that take advantage of theprotective effects of skeletal muscle.\"},{\"abstract\":\"The role of the Leadership Administrative Core (LAC) is to integrate and unify the multiple, interdisciplinarycomponents of the Brigham and Women?s Hospital\\/Harvard Medical School (Brigham\\/Harvard) Centerfor Stress and Neural Regulation of Reproductive Aging Health Outcomes.

Metabolicrisk factors that may emerge or worsen in the perimenopausal period include increases in central adiposity, bloodpressure, glucose, and non-HDL cholesterol, which are associated with later development of type 2 diabetesmellitus, cardiovascular disease, and dementia. Many perimenopausal women also experience neuropsychiatricchanges including symptoms of vasomotor instability, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, and memoryproblems, which represent major detriments to quality of life and may be important sex-specific risk factors forcardiometabolic diseases and dementia caused by both VCID and AD. Numerous studies have characterizedgenetic and behavioral risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and dementia in middle adulthood. Lessattention has focused on physiologic and social stressors, which affect all body systems and heighten multiplerisk factors, as contributors to these diseases. Absolute risks differ by sex and lifestage: while premenopausalwomen are at lower risk for CVD and dementia than men, risks increase dramatically through and after themenopausal transition. Lifetime social stressors and physiologic stressors during reproductive transitions uniqueto women may substantially account for the sex-specific risks of cardiometabolic diseases and dementia. Yet,few studies have addressed these relationships in depth with prospective longitudinal follow-up. This Project willtest our overall hypothesis that perimenopausal women with higher exposure to social stressors throughout lifeand physiological stressors during important reproductive transitions?pregnancy, the peripartum period, andthe perimenopause?will have greater cardiometabolic risk, more neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms, andpoorer sleep duration and quality. Highly prevalent exposures of interest include physiological stressors (excessgestational weight gain, dysglycemia\\/gestational diabetes mellitus, elevated blood pressure\\/hypertensivedisorders of pregnancy, and excess postpartum weight retention) as well as social stressors (adverse childhoodevents, exposures to racism and violence, and financial instability). Furthermore, we hypothesize that theserelations are mediated by adverse weight trajectories. To address these hypotheses, we will leverage ProjectViva, an ongoing, highly engaged cohort of women recruited in early pregnancy 1999?2002 (at mean age 32years) and followed annually for almost 2 decades. This proposal provides an exceptional opportunity to informclinical care for aging women by leveraging outstanding existing data and resources and including over 20 yearsof high- quality prospective assessments within a 5-year period.

Recently, neuronsproducing the neuropeptides kisspeptin (encoded by the Kiss1 gene), neurokinin B (NKB, encoded by Tac2),and dynorphin (Dyn, encoded by Pdyn) and referred to as KNDy neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleusof mice have been identified as mediators of hot flashes through a common pathway that also controls pulsatileGnRH secretion and the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Based on this dual role ofKNDy neurons, we hypothesize that factors that negatively impact reproductive function, such as stress andhypercortisolemia, act through KNDy neurons and will also affect thermoregulation (i.e., VMS) and sleep inmenopausal patients. To this end, using mouse models of menopause and VMS, we aim to: 1) determine ifthese effects occur through direct regulation of Kiss1 or indirectly through regulation of Tac2 or Pdyn; and 2)determine if these effects occur on the KNDy neurons themselves and\\/or via neurons upstream of KNDyneurons?specifically, via GABAergic neurons. In addition, given the association of the menopausal decline ofsex steroids with not only VMS but also disruption of sleep patterns, we aim to explore the relationships ofstress, corticosteroids and KNDy neurons in the absence of sex steroids with sleep disruption. The successfulcompletion of this proposal will offer important new mechanistic insights into the roles and effects of stress onKNDy neurons, the HPG axis, VMS, and associated sleep disturbances with the assistance of the Sleep Core.These insights will be critical to inform the development of new, safer and more effective tools to mitigate theeffects of stress and of hot flashes in women, as studied in Project 1 and Project 2 of this SCORE application,and thereby improve reproductive health aging outcomes in women.--NARRATIVEReproductive aging in women (i.e.; menopause) leads to a number of distressing physiological alterationsassociated with the decrease in circulating estrogens; among which vasomotor symptoms (also referred to ashot flashes) significantly disrupt sleep and disturb quality of life and may be relevant to subsequent risk of adversehealth outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and dementia. Stress can affect the severity of vasomotorsymptoms; however; the mechanisms underlying the control of thermoregulation by sex steroids and how thiscan be modulated by stress remain unknown. We aim to address this knowledge gap by using a series of genetic;behavioral and pharmacological approaches to identify the neuronal circuitry connecting the reproductive axis;stress; thermoregulation; and sleep quality.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACTAge-related hearing loss and Alzheimer?s disease dementia (Alzheimer?s) are distinct neurologic conditionsthat affect millions of older adults worldwide. Age-related hearing loss is the third most common, chroniccondition and the most common sensory deficit among older adults. From prior work, we have identifiedhearing loss as a risk factor for dementia through epidemiologic studies. The mechanisms of how age-relatedhearing loss cause Alzheimer?s or whether treating hearing loss decreases the risk for Alzheimer?s, however,are unknown. For patients on the extreme end of the hearing loss spectrum with severe-profound hearing loss,the most effective form of hearing restoration is with a cochlear implant (CI). It is unknown how an interventionto restore hearing via cochlear implantation will have any cognitive benefit or will decrease the risk ofdeveloping Alzheimer?s. We hypothesize that restoring hearing via cochlear implantation in older adults withsevere-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss will mitigate the risk of AD. We also hypothesize CI will improveneuropsychological well-being, as determined by clinical and social metrics, in older adults with hearing loss,thus reducing risk for Alzheimer?s. To evaluate whether CI can mitigate the risk and decrease the incidence of AD, we propose using the UtahPopulation Database (UPDB) to answer this important question. The Utah Population Database (UPDB) is aunique database that contains records of over 11 million individuals linked with health histories, andgenealogies, spanning from the 1800?s to current day. It serves as a powerful epidemiologic tool that can beused to look at trends of incidence and prevalence of disease over time. The UPDB has not yet been utilizedto evaluate cochlear implant outcomes in older adults. Using the UPDB is an innovative and novel way toevaluate the impact of hearing loss on cognition and Alzheimer?s. This project will evaluate the largestcohort of older CI recipients to be studied to answer important questions relating to aging research. Utilizingthis database could provide new insights into the pathology and management of how treating hearing loss mayprevent dementia. The significance of this work is to determine if hearing restoration via a CI can prevent AD in older adultswith hearing loss. Completion of this study will better inform future studies looking at how hearing health canbenefit older adults.--PROJECT NARRATIVEThis proposal is significant to public health because of the high prevalence of severe-profound age-relatedhearing loss in older adults. Little is known about the collateral effects of this degree of hearing loss on non-hearing aspects of life; such as hearing loss causing Alzheimer?s disease dementia. By understanding thecognitive and quality of life impact of cochlear implantation in older adults; there is the potential to decreaseAlzheimer?s disease in this patient population.\"},{\"abstract\":\"AbstractRecent studies in Alzheimer?s Disease (AD) patients report localized retinal thinning and A? inclusionsin the neurosensory retina, suggesting the eye?s utility as a non-invasive indicator of brain health.However, variation in methodologies between studies and other retinal complications due to otherdiseases and age limit the use of the retina as a potential AD biomarker. A comprehensive micro-levelanalysis of the retina is necessary to validate macrolevel clinical assessments. To identify potentialbiological mechanisms related to AD-associated retinal altercations, we will conduct a transcriptomicanalysis of topographic and anatomical regions of retinal tissue from the left eye of autopsy-confirmedcases alongside age-matched non-diseased tissue. Retinal tissue from the right eye of the same ADcase will undergo histopathological assessment for altercations of retinal structure and morphology tocorrelate changes in gene expression with retinal pathology. Secondly, we will use single-celltranscriptomics to identify specific retinal subpopulations impacted by AD. We hypothesize that AD-associated transcriptional alterations will localize to retinal subpopulations implicated in AD retinalpathology such as retinal ganglion cells and provide context to the retinal thinning observed in ADpatients. Brain tissue from the corresponding AD case will be stained through in situ hybridization fortranscripts identified through bulk and single-cell RNA-seq analysis to correlate AD brainpathophysiology to AD retinal disease progression. Results from these studies would provide additionalmechanistic insight into the retinal thinning observed in AD and provide vital context to assess thefeasibility of using the retina as a biomarker for AD disease progression.--Project NarrativeThe molecular mechanisms underlying AD-induced retinal changes is not well understood. We propose toexamine AD retinal susceptibility through transcriptional profiling as well as conventional retinal techniques.Our goal is to objectively validate retinal changes in AD as well as provide a curated resource to identifycandidate genes potentially involved in AD-mediated retinal changes.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Clinical studies have suggested a link between the loss of sensory function in the inner ear and thedevelopment of Alzheimer?s disease. The biological basis of this association is not clear. Neurodegenerationthat occurs in Alzheimer?s disease (AD) appears to be caused by aberrant processing and clustering of proteinfragments derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the microtubule-associated protein Tau.Consistent with this notion, certain identified mutations in APP and Tau are known to greatly increase the riskof developing AD. The projects outlined here are partly motivated by our observation that high levels of APPand Tau are also present in the hair cells and afferent neurons of the cochlea and vestibular organs, raising thepossibility that these proteins might contribute to degeneration in the aging inner ear. However, it is equallypossible that inner ear dysfunction is linked to AD because the loss of sensory input from the aging inner earincreases the likelihood of CNS degeneration and dementia. Experiments proposed here will use establishedmouse models of Alzheimer?s disease and engineered deafness to address these issues. In Aim 1, we willdetermine whether b-amyloid and Tau deposition and subsequent degeneration occurs in the inner ear.Experiments in Aim 2 will test whether disruption of inner ear function leads to increased CNS neuropathologyin a mouse model of Alzheimer?s disease. To our knowledge, these will be the first studies to directly examinethe potential relationship between inner ear function and amyloid-related CNS pathology. The outcomes mayreveal a role for APP in degeneration of the inner ear, or indicate that input from the ear affects amyloiddeposition in the CNS. A more complete understanding of the link between inner ear function and Alzheimer?sdisease may also lead to novel diagnostics for the detection of early stage AD in humans.--Clinical studies suggest that hearing and vestibular deficits are associated with the development of Alzheimer?sdisease. We have shown that amyloid precursor protein (APP - an important mediator of neurodegeneration inAlzheimer?s disease) is abundantly expressed in the inner ear. Proposed projects will examine the possiblepathological role of APP in the cochlea and vestibular organs; and also examine whether loss of sensoryfunction in the ear leads to early degeneration in the central nervous system.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACT:Clinical gait abnormalities are present in about 35% of community-dwellingolder adults in the US, and accelerated gait decline is associated with many adverse physical and cognitiveoutcomes - including falls, disability, cognitive decline, and dementia. Such outcomes not only reduces the qualityof life of affected individuals, their families, and friends, but also leads to increased health care costs. In 2000the direct costs of falls among older adults exceeded $19 billion, and the cost of health care following anemergency visit for an injurious fall among older adults totaled 6.8 billion in the US. In 2014, the estimated costof formal care to people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias was 214 billion in the US, plus another220 billion in estimated costs for informal care provided by family members and other unpaid caregivers. Hence,a better understanding of trajectories, and modifiable risk factors, of brain, gait, and cognitive decline in agingcan have a tremendous impact on individuals as well as to society. We aim to compare and contrasttrajectories of functional and structural brain changes with gait decline and cognitive decline incognitively-healthy older adults, and older adults in the early stages of cognitive decline. We hypothesizethat functional and structural changes in the control pathway of human locomotion ? including supplementarymotor, insular, and prefrontal cortex regions ? precede (or have earlier change points than) gait decline andcognitive decline (Hypothesis 1a), and that functional brain changes precede structural brain changes(Hypothesis 1b). We further hypothesize that functional and structural decline in these regions will be steeper orhave earlier change points in older adults with the motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome (Hypothesis 2) ? apre-dementia syndrome characterized by slow gait and cognitive complaint ? as well as in older adults with fewhigh-contact social relationships and poor social networks (Hypothesis 3).

The major contributors to stroke-relateddisability are motor and cognitive deficits, which tend to worsen over time, especially in aged individuals. Strokealso accelerates other age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy(CAA). The prevalence of respiratory dysfunction is high in stroke patients and it impairs recovery and increasesmortality. Studies investigating the mechanisms underlying stroke-induced respiratory dysfunction (SIRD) are intheir infancy. Even less is known about how disordered breathing can influence motor and cognitive outcomesafter stroke, especially in aged individuals that have other features of neurodegeneration, including cerebralamyloid. There are currently no animal models of post-stroke respiratory dysfunction, limiting our ability toinvestigate the mechanism of respiratory dysfunction after stroke or to develop interventions to stabilize breathingto improve cognition. Our preliminary data shows that stroke leads to the development of periodic breathing andapnea in mice, the severity of which is correlated with both mortality and progressive cognitive decline insurvivors. Stroke is also very common in AD and CAA patients and SIRD may contribute to cognitive decline inAD and CAA, increasing amyloid burden. Treatment of stroke disordered breathing may decrease A? burdenand reduce neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD and CAA patients with vascular disease. We haverecently discovered that stroke induces astrogliosis in brain areas remote from the infarct, includingchemoreceptor areas of the brainstem and reducing gliosis specifically in brainstem improves SIRD andcognition. Mechanistically, we will determine the cellular source (likely astrocytes at the neurovascular interface),the molecular mediators (likely transforming growth factor ?, TGF?), and the physiological contribution of this tothe development and progression of SIRD and cognitive decline. We have developed an animal model of post-stroke respiratory dysfunction that recapitulates the physiology seen in stroke patients and is tightly linked topost-stroke cognitive function. We will now investigate sex differences in this model and investigate if strokeaccelerates cognitive decline in transgenic mice that develop AD or CAA. Finally we will determine themechanisms responsible for stroke-induced respiratory pathophysiology and will attempt to develop therapeuticapproaches to stabilize breathing and enhance recovery of cognitive function. Our central hypothesis is that theseverity of disordered breathing correlates with cognitive and motor decline after stroke in wild-type, AD andCAA mice and that this is secondary to widespread age-enhanced astrogliosis, leading to impairedchemoreception and progressive apnea.

Thiscondition is much more detrimental than `hard of hearing', rather, it has been implicated in a host of co-morbidities such as cognitive deficits, including dementia and Alzheimer's Disease. It remains unclear ifthis is a cause and effect situation or an epiphenomenon. If the former, simple interventions may well leadto much better mental health among the elderly. The long-term goal of the proposed research program isto identify the neural coding principles that allow listeners to make sense of, and focus on, particularsounds (i.e. what you are listening to) when they occur mixed with other sounds (i.e. the background),something that is common in many listening situations. Although this is an extremely difficultcomputational problem, people with normal hearing solve it effortlessly. Unfortunately, this remarkableability almost always declines with age, leaving individuals struggling to understand speech in noisyenvironments. In order to develop assistive technologies or therapies to restore this critical function, weneed to understand how the brain processes sounds in complex acoustic scenes, and, in particular, exactlyhow it fails to do so in aged individuals. Age-related shifts in the coding strategy employed at differentstages of the auditory pathway are believed to involve compensatory changes related to attenuated inputfrom more peripheral stages, and recent research in older animals has demonstrated quantitative andqualitative changes in central neural representation of complex sounds. Crucially, these changes appear toinvolve changes in how information is transformed along the cortical hierarchy. For this reason, a rigorousstudy of the effects of age-related hearing loss must include a comparison of cortical areas, such as coreversus belt, that function at different levels of the processing hierarchy in normal hearing. Moreover, thesecentral changes impact not only `bottom-up' sound processing along the ascending auditory pathway, butalso `top-down' modulation by attention. The proposed studies will therefore contrast how complex soundsin challenging listening environments are processed in young versus old animals while those animals areperforming perceptual tasks that either do or do not require auditory attention. These studies will be thefirst to track changes in how multiple complex sounds are encoded across hierarchical levels of processingin the auditory pathway in a primate model of aging, while allowing direct comparisons betweencortical response changes and auditory perceptual deficits.--PROJECT NARRATIVEThe most common complaint with respect to sensory processing among the aged is the reduced abilityto understand speech in noisy environments. We currently have only a limited understanding of howchanges in the central nervous system reflect these perceptual deficits; which can be devastating asthey can leave aged individuals socially isolated; depressed; suicidal and has been correlated withAlzheimer's Disease.

Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI) are widely used for a number ofconditions beyond hypertension. They can be categorized as centrally or peripherally acting based upon theirability to cross the blood brain barrier. Available data suggests that centrally acting ACEI decrease the rate ofcognitive and functional decline among those with Alzheimer?s Disease and related disorders. My specificaims focus on older individuals without Alzheimer?s disease and related disorders and are to 1) Toquantify motoric consequences (gait velocity) of CACE-I versus PACE-I use in older adults using the nationallyrepresentative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) database. 2) To determine cognitive consequences ofCACE-I versus PACE-I use in older adults using the HRS. 3) To examine the relation of CACE-I and PACE-Iuse with neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies linked to dementia using the Alzheimer?s diseaseNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.Early identification of older adults at risk for the development of cognitive impairment and decline in physicalperformance, coupled with a better understanding of how ACEI subtypes affect cortical regions associated withdementia, is of paramount importance as a prelude to identification of targeted therapies to slow theprogression of cognitive impairment in aging and Alzheimer?s Disease. There is a knowledge gap regardingclinical consequences of different classes of ACEI that limits evidence based prescribing. This proposal willproduce clinically relevant data that will form the basis of an R01 designed to extend this line of research intoadditional cohorts, to allow for more detailed investigations into the use of CACE-I and related agents inprotecting against declines in gait and cognition in older adults at risk for Alzheimer?s disease and relateddisorders.--Project Narrative:The proposed study will examine if there are differential effects of angiotensin convertingenzyme inhibitor (ACEI) subtypes on 1) motoric; 2) cognitive; and 3) neurodegenerative andvascular outcomes among participants in 2 nationally available cohorts. It will be the first toexamine these outcomes in older adults on ACEI without dementia. Early identification of olderadults at risk for the development of cognitive impairment and functional decline; coupled with abetter understanding of how this commonly prescribed medication affects cortical regionsassociated with dementia; is of paramount importance as a prelude to identification of targetedtherapies to slow the progression of dementia.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Due to an aging population and increased lifespan, dementia is an increasing clinical and public health issue. The most common and well-known cause is Alzheimer?s disease (AD), but other important disorders are involved in the development of AD-related dementias (ADRD). What is less appreciated is that Parkinson?s disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease, while often associated with motor dysfunction, contributes to ADRD with an incidence of dementia as high as 80% in late stages in which most have AD co-pathology. Therefore, this population exhibits a range of cognitive deficits that enables insight into mechanisms involved in ADRD. There seem to be two distinct cognitive profiles in these patients. One is a benign frontal profile characterized by executive and attention deficits, whereas the other is a posterior profile characterized by memory and visuospatial deficits that is associated with faster progression to dementia, often with AD co-pathology. The premise of this application is that identifying the neural circuitry underlying frontal and posterior function may provide insight into structural alterations occurring in ADRD. Dopaminergic therapies are known to improve frontal circuitry function, but not posterior circuitry, leading to the hypothesis that posterior circuit alterations are due to non-dopaminergic pathology, such as AD co-pathology. If true, the pattern of frontal-vs-posterior involvement may lead to differential responses to current treatments in ADRD. I plan to apply diffusion tensor tractography, a sensitive and widely available MRI technique, to measure microstructural integrity of white matter (WM) connections between brain regions. My central hypothesis is that WM alterations in frontal and posterior circuitry occurs in PD (Aim 1); that these alterations are associated with specific cognitive deficits and relate to differing rates of progression to dementia (Aim 2); and the ratio of frontal to posterior damage (F\\/P ratio) modulates the cognitive response to treatment (e.g., levodopa, deep brain stimulation, Aim 3). These aims will be implemented by leveraging existing datasets allowing a cost-effective and impactful investigation. This study immediately will impact knowledge of WM circuits related to dementia with insight into underlying mechanisms and therapeutic strategies, as well as provide the foundational line of research for future study of microstructural signatures of AD\\/ADRD. I have assembled a world-class mentoring team with expertise in areas related to my research and a history of highly-successful mentoring. The environment and institutional resources available to me for this project are excellent with a well-developed training plan and access to required equipment and research datasets. The proposed project and training plan will position me at the intersection of neuroscience and engineering, and enable me to tackle important clinical problems with the latest technological advancements. My new skills in neuroimaging analysis and neuropsychological testing to probe neurocognitive circuitry will provide a foundation for my career as an independent physician-engineer focused on alleviating the burden of AD\\/ADRD.--PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive decline is a growing global health concern due to unprecedented increases in the agingpopulation. This proposal will test whether certain neural ?hubs? may play unique roles in cognitive functions andtreatment outcomes in Parkinson?s disease; a major risk factor for dementia. Studying the effects of Parkinson?sdisease on white matter integrity related to cognition will generate clinically useful insights into the subtype;prognosis; and pathophysiology of cognitive decline.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating movement disorder (affecting ~5 million world?wide) resulting fromselective death of dopamine (DA) neurons. To date, numerous rarely encountered exposures have beeninvestigated as risk factors, but none have been clearly linked to PD. Further, the translation of therapeutics thatare promising in animal studies to successful clinical trials has been very poor. These gaps in the field suggestserious weaknesses in the utilization of animal models in PD research. Most PD studies test hypotheses in singlemodel systems. However, there are clear advantages with respect to increasing the strength of the findings andadvancing the field through understanding species differences. This R21 aims to be highly responsive to PAR?17?039 (Comparative Biology of Neurodegeneration) by testing PD?relevant neurodegeneration across threephylogenetically diverse animal model systems. In the spirit of an R21, the proposal utilizes high risk\\/highreward approaches, where novel risk factors will be tested to advance the understanding of the biology of PD.Per? and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widespread environmental contaminants that have beeninvestigated as developmental toxicants, with little information on long?term neurotoxicity. Our preliminarymechanistic and neuropathology data in nematode and amphibian models suggest that exposure to PFAS,especially perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) induces selective PD?relevant, DAergic neurotoxicity. This projectwill address an important gap on how PFAS exposure leads to long?term neurological disease risk. We will testthe hypothesis: that species?specific responses to PFOS?induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration will advanceunderstanding of the biology of PD. Importantly, the hypothesis will be tested across 3 animal model systems,where concordance will strengthen findings, and discordance will identify biological aspects of species?specificsensitivity to environmentally?induced neurodegeneration. We will test our hypothesis through two aims: Aim1. To identify species specific?PFOS doses that induce DAergic neurodegeneration. PFOS doses will beharmonized across systems to achieve brain levels that bear environmental relevance. Harmonization of internaldose levels to set external applied dosages for each model system will allow us to interrogate mechanistichypothesis under comparable insults; Aim 2. Identify neurobiological underpinnings across species thatcontribute to differential sensitivity to PFOS?induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Here, we will identifyspecies?specific differences in neurodegeneration that may underlie critical aspects of selective dopaminergicneurotoxicity induced by PFOS exposure. We will conduct comparative biology studies that are both phenotypicand mechanistic. Resultant data will be critical in determining: 1) Which species is best suited to PFOSneurodegeneration studies; 2) Identifying which pathogenic pathways directly correlate withneurodegeneration across species. These studies will mechanistically advance the field far beyond data fromtypical single?species studies.--Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widespread environmental contaminants that have been linkedto numerous adverse health outcomes. Our recent data strongly suggest that PFAS may produce Parkinson?sdisease (PD) relevant neurodegeneration. In this proposal; we will utilize comparative biology approaches toadvance understanding of PD neurodegeneration and the neurological risks of PFAS exposure.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome (MCR) is a pre-dementia syndrome characterized by the presence of subjectivecognitive complaints and slow gait. MCR affects almost in 1 in 10 older adults, and has a high incidence in aging.MCR predicts risk of both Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and vascular dementia even after accounting for clinicaloverlap with Mild Cognitive Impairment syndrome (MCI). Complex cognitive tests or laboratory assays are notrequired for diagnosing MCR, increasing its clinical utility. MCR has incremental predictive validity for dementiaover its individual cognitive (cognitive complaints) and motoric (slow gait) components. Yet, the biologicalunderpinnings of MCR are not yet established. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to establish aconsortium of eight cohorts with ~11,000 community-dwelling older adults with clinical phenotypes,biological\\/genetic, and neuroimaging data; a time and cost efficient approach to examine the biology of MCR.Aim 1. Identify biological mechanisms underlying MCR incidence. Modifiable risk factors for incident MCRinclude depressive symptoms, obesity, and low physical activity; which are correlated with each other as well asshare common biological derangements in inflammatory, oxidative stress and vascular pathways. We also linkedAlzheimer and obesity-related polygenic risk scores to prevalent MCR at cross-section. Building on thesefindings, we will examine biomarkers and polygenic risk of developing incident MCR. We will test our hypothesesprimarily in individual cohorts and secondarily in a pooled sample of 8,300 individuals with biomarker data.Aim 2. Establish neuroanatomical substrates of MCR syndrome. We linked a novel gray matter atrophynetwork to MCR at cross-section in 3 of our cohorts, which was composed of areas linked primarily, but notexclusively, to motor control. Herein, we will examine if this brain network is vulnerable early in MCR, and predictsincident MCR. This aim will be tested primarily in individual cohorts, and secondarily in a pooled subsample of~2,120 individuals with 3T MRIs. Furthermore, in a subset of 1,100 individuals with up to 3 serial MRIs, we willexamine longitudinal changes in this unique brain network in the context of MCR and small vessel disease.Aim 3. Compare and contrast biology and brain substrates for MCR and MCI syndromes. We will exploresimilarities and differences in new biological associations as well as known AD risk factors with MCR and MCI.There is only partial clinical overlap between MCR and MCI. While we expect partial biological overlap, ourstudies show exclusive genetic predispositions, brain pathologies and brain substrates for MCR not seen withMCI. The MCR syndrome is not conceptualized as an alternate to MCI but complementary.--Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome (MCR) is a recently described pre-dementia syndrome;characterized by the presence of subjective cognitive complaints and slow gait that identifiespeople at high risk of Alzheimer?s disease and vascular dementia.

One possible reason could be varying amounts ofcognitive reserve, or brain health which protects them from clinical manifestations. Thus, just as a healthy bonemass through life protects from osteoporosis and fractures, having a healthy brain at age 65-85, a consequenceof genetic propensity and lifelong environmental, behavioral and disease-related factors, will protect fromdevelopment of AD, dementia and stroke. How do we define a healthy brain phenotype? Brain health is typicallycharacterized using quantitative measurements MRI and PET brain imaging, cognitive testing and at autopsy.Other dimensions of brain health, often altered in aging, prior to cognition, include retinal structure andvasculature, olfactory, visual, auditory, tactile and sensory perception and motor abilities. Sensory-motormeasures are promising early biomarkers of AD and may play a causal role in the development or progressionof dementia. An NIA workshop titled ?Sensory and Motor dysfunctions in Aging and AD? concluded thatcomprehensive sensory motor testing would provide key mechanistic insights into AD pathogenesis. Wepropose to incorporate multiple such sensory-motor measures in the recently funded 10th exam for 1874Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring and Omni 1 cohort participants and develop a multi-dimensionalsensory-motor Brain Health Index (smBHI), as well as a composite BHI (cBHI) that additionally includes brainMRI and cognitive measures. Predictors and outcomes related to the BHI will be identified using the extensiveprofiling of risk factors, repeated measures of brain structure and function, information on MCI, dementia (ADand VCID) and stroke outcomes already available in FHS. It will be validated in 3 additional population samples,200 African- Americans in Jackson, MS, 400 Hispanic participants in San Antonio, Texas and 1650 Europeanancestry participants in the Great Age Study in Barri, Italy (LOS only, will collect and analyze data with Italianfunding.

We areproposing a new way of capturing brain health ? by assessing ?sensory- motor? function using measurementsof smell; vision; hearing; gait; touch and balance using non-invasive tests. These changes are typicallyconsidered part of normal aging; but recent research has shown that these could be early warning signs ofdementia.

AD-related brain changes may occur years or decadesbefore the onset of symptoms and, therefore, it is important to identify, in midlife, people at high risk for AD toprovide ample opportunity to intervene when it may be possible to delay the onset of clinically significantsymptoms and loss of independence. Longitudinal studies have shown that sensory (hearing, vision, olfaction)and motor impairments are associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment, dementia, or AD. Thisproject is to study the impact of aging changes in sensory function (hearing, olfaction, vision, and taste) andmotor function on the 10-yr risk of pre-clinical AD in middle-aged adults. The Beaver Dam Offspring Study is alongitudinal cohort study of sensory and cognitive aging in the adult offspring of the population-basedEpidemiology of Hearing Loss Study cohort. Data from participants (N=1536, mean age 49 years) who havestored serum samples from the baseline (2005-2008), 5-yr follow-up (2010-2013) and 10-yr follow-up (2015-2017) examinations will be included. Stored samples from the three time points will be assayed for serumamyloid ?40 and ?42 (A?40, A?42), serum total tau (TT) and neurofilament light chain (NfL); biomarkers ofAlzheimer?s pathology, neuronal injury and neurodegeneration.Least squares multiple linear regression models and longitudinal linear mixed effects models will be used todetermine if sensory and motor function and other traditional risk factors for AD and dementia are associatedwith levels of A?, TT and NfL at baseline and 10-year change, respectively, in these serum biomarkers. Thebiomarkers, A?, TT and NfL, and thickness of the macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (mGCIPL) will beapplied to a modification of the NIA-Alzheimer?s Association AT(N) framework to identify preclinical Alzheimer?sand non-Alzheimer?s neuropathology in midlife. Using this modified framework and traditional cognitiveoutcomes we will determine if sensory and motor changes in aging contribute to 10-year risk prediction modelsfor biologically and functionally defined preclinical AD. The best prediction model results will be extended tocreate clinically useful risk scores. Risk scores for asymptomatic middle-aged people which are based onpractical test batteries will be useful in clinical and research settings.--The proposed study will contribute important new information about the utility of sensory andmotor changes as markers of preclinical Alzheimer?s disease and provide clinically usefulmethods to identify people in midlife who are at high risk for preclinical Alzheimer?s disease andcognitive decline.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary Alzheimer's disease (AD) degrades the ability to learn and make appropriate decisions. As the basalforebrain cholinergic system is highly susceptible to amyloidosis, one neuromodulator that is especiallyimplicated in cognitive decline caused by AD is acetylcholine, which is essential in many forms of learning andmemory. While higher-order brain areas associated with decision-making have been intensively investigated asthey relate to AD, recently there has been a call for greater focus on the consequences of AD in sensory- andmotor-related areas. As we have previously characterized a cholinergic-dependent form of learning and memoryin the visual cortex, one sensory- and motor-related system that is particularly attractive in this regard is thevisual corticostriatal pathway. A rudimentary, yet fundamental, form of decision-making that epitomizes asensorimotor transformation carried out by the corticostriatal pathway is when to time reward-seeking actionsin response to reward-predicting stimuli. Observation of neural activity from the visual cortex and the dorsalstriatum reveal visually-cued timing activity to expected reward, providing a window into the process oftransforming visual cues into reward-seeking motor action. By combining a mouse model of AD that developsamyloidosis with a line that affords a means to control and functionally image cholinergic axons, the effects ofamyloidosis on cholinergic-dependent interval timing activity can be assessed, neurally and behaviorally,compared to that caused by the normal course of aging, and rescued by augmenting cholinergic signaling ofreward using a novel optogenetic intervention. We hypothesize that aging and amyloidosis disrupts the ability of the visual corticostriatal system to learnand produce visually-cued interval timing activity (Aim1-Impairment), which degrades the ability to produceappropriately timed reward-seeking behaviors, and that the proximal cause is a functional impairment ofcholinergic signaling of reward (Aim2-Proximal Cause). We further hypothesize that optogeneticaugmentation of intact cholinergic fibers' report of reward will rescue visually-cued interval timing activity in thecorticostriatal system, thereby re-establishing appropriately timed reward-seeking behavior (Aim3-Intervention). These aims will 1) reveal new neurophysiological and behavioral biomarkers foretelling futureonset of the disease (Aim1), 2) lead to a greater understanding of the causative processes underlying cognitivedecline (Aim2), and 3) point to new interventions for mitigating dysfunction caused by AD pathology (Aim3).--Project NarrativeAmyloidosis?a hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease?especially damages the cholinergic system; leading to severecognitive impairments.

Fronto-striatal executive\\/attentional impairments are core early features and areinfluenced by dopaminergic neurotransmission. PDD arises when a distinct visuospatial cognitive syndrome--thought to be mediated by non-dopaminergic changes?begins to substantially affect the integrity of posteriorcortical regions. The pathological substrates underlying these impairments are diverse and involve the toxiceffects of misfolded neuronal alpha-synuclein along with non-synuclein pathologies such as Amyloid-beta(Abeta) plaques, tau aggregates, and vascular cognitive impairment. The heterogeneous nature of thesepathologies and their clinical manifestations is summarized by the ?dual-hit? hypothesis: a well-accepted butnever-before-tested principle in current models of PD?PDD pathogenesis. We propose a proof-of-concept PDtrial aimed at delaying visuospatial cognitive decline, a critical component of PDD. In PD, low-range corticalAbeta plaque levels?well below the Alzheimer?s disease (AD) diagnostic threshold?associate with serotoninterminal losses. This specific serotonin-Abeta characteristic is true of PD but not AD. Our published multicenterPD observational findings show that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) associate with lower PDDconversion risk and altered CSF Abeta-42 levels. Our preliminary data, using Abeta Pittsburgh compound B(PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) in PD, show less 2-year visuospatial cortex Abeta plaque accrualand reduced visuospatial cognitive decline in subjects on serotoninergic medications, perhaps modifying a keyarbiter of PD?PDD risk. Our long-term vision is a PD?PDD prevention trial, in which citalopram would beinitiated prior to Abeta-linked cognitive decline. Our central hypothesis is that citalopram use in PD will reducevisuospatial cortex Abeta plaque accrual, leading to an amelioration of visuospatial cognitive decline linked toPDD. Our objective is to test this hypothesis in a proof-of-concept trial of citalopram 20mg daily over 2 years inPD subjects (age ?65) without depression (n=58). In Aim 1, we will test differences in 2-year PiB PET accrualwithin the visuospatial cortex between citalopram and placebo groups. In Aim 2, we will measure the impact ofthis visuospatial cortex Abeta intervention upon visuospatial cognitive function. In Aim 3, we will test whethercitalopram relative to placebo confers a minimal clinically important difference of benefit as assessed by acommon measure of multi-domain cognition, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, linked to PDD diagnosis. Atthe conclusion of this study, we will have well-powered dataset to assess our rigorous Go\\/No-Go criteria forthis safe and generalizable PDD prevention therapy. We will also conduct analyses (Aims 1, 2, & 3) that willhelp to either substantiate or invalidate the dual-hit model of PD?PDD pathogenesis, a significant contributionto the PD field with implications for other Alzheimer?s disease and related dementia (ADRD) conditions as well.--Project NarrativeWe propose a proof-of-concept trial in Parkinson disease (PD) to test whether 2 years of citalopram; comparedto placebo; can alter the build-up of toxic amyloid-beta plaques in the visuospatial cortex of the brain linked tovisuospatial cognitive impairment in PD.

Expression of the ?-4 allele of human apolipoprotein E (APOE-4) gene,the strongest genetic risk factor for development of the episodic late-onset AD, associates tightly with theearliest AD symptom - olfactory deficit (OD) in humans. Animals expressing the human APOE-4 gene evinceOD symptoms before AD pathogenesis, indicating a role of APOE-4 in functional disorders of the olfactorysystem. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the APOE-4 effects on olfaction remainunclear. We hypothesize that APOE-4 dysregulates neural circuits leading to excitation-inhibition imbalanceand neural hyperactivity in the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) to cause OD at the early stage of AD basedon the following evidence. First, the hallmark AD pathologies appear in the AON in the Braak stages 0 and Iof the disease and increase with AD severity. APOE-4 elevates AD pathogenesis. Second, the severity of ADpathology (especially tau hyperphosphorylation) in the AON correlates linearly with the copies of APOE-4allele. Third, AON has direct interconnections with the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, hippocampus, amygdala,and lateral entorhinal cortex. All these olfactory centers exhibit vulnerability to AD pathogenesis at earlystages in humans and neuronal hyperexcitability in transgenic animals with humanized APOE-4 genotype.Based on our preliminary data and the massive interconnections of AON with all other olfactory brain centersvia glutamatergic transmission that is particularly susceptible to detrimental effects of APOE-4, wehypothesize that APOE-4 causes excitation-inhibition imbalance in the AON and dysfunction of related neuralcircuits leading to OD. Three specific aims are proposed to test our central hypothesis. Aim 1: DetermineAPOE-4 impact on olfaction-dependent behaviors. Aim 2: Investigate APOE-4 effects on AON neuronalexcitability. Aim 3: Characterize APOE-4 influence on synaptic processing in the AON. The proposed work isdesigned to fill gaps in our knowledge on the mechanistic relationship between APOE-4, a well-establishedgenetic risk factor of LOAD, and OD at the cellular, circuit, and behavioral levels. Our findings will potentiallyshed light on development of effective strategies for early and accurate diagnosis of AD in the APOE-4-carrying or even broader populations. Since AD progressively impairs patient?s cognitive and other mentalabilities for years to decades thus significantly compromises the quality of life in the senior populations in theUS and worldwide, early and accurate diagnosis of this neurodegeneration will significantly benefit theaffected populations and their societies at the medical, economical, emotional, and social levels.--Project NarrativeDue to the lack of approaches for curing Alzheimer?s disease (AD) or slowing down its progression;identifying risk factors or preclinical symptoms and understanding the mechanisms underlying theirinteractions are of critical importance to early diagnosis and preventative effort. This project aims to revealthe pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the APOE-4-induced olfactory deficit at the anterior olfactorynucleus level and potentially sheds light on developing new approaches for early diagnosis of AD.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARYMany age-related oral health problems, such as masticatory dysfunction, dysphagia, periodontal disease, and tooth losshave been associated with Alzheimer?s disease (AD). How cortical and biomechanical changes in oromotor behaviorcontribute to the onset and progression of AD and age-related dementias (ARD) are widely unknown. This is largelybecause of a fundamental gap in understanding the neuromechanical processes, at the level of large-scale activity of singleneurons and neuronal networks, that underlie healthy aging. This represents an important problem because until theyare understood, the cortical mechanisms underlying pathological aging in AD\\/ARD will remain largely incomprehensible.The goal of the proposed research is to investigate changes in the orofacial sensorimotor-cognitive neuronal network thatunderlie healthy age-related sensorimotor changes and how these cortical correlates are affected by absent sensory inputsto oral structures and by the presence of AD-like impairments (?pathological aging?) in old rhesus macaques. The centralhypothesis is that differential patterns of the dynamics of large-scale neural activity and connectivity in the orofacialsensorimotor cortex (OSMcx) and the ventrolateral frontal cortex (VLFcx) will help disambiguate healthy and pathologicalaging. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) to identify the neuronal correlates of healthy age-related changes in feeding behavior, (2) to identify changes in cortical representations of oral somatosensation followingsensory nerve block, and (3) to identify changes in neuronal responses and cortical interactions in OSMcx-VLFcx networksfollowing drug-induced AD-like impairments. Thus, we can evaluate and compare the added burden of sensory loss andAD-like impairments on aging. The proposed research uses an innovative approach that leverages the unique sensoryinnervation of the oral region by different cranial nerves and the use of a pharmacological model to induce AD-likeimpairments in old rhesus macaques. We will record cortical activity from multiple chronically implanted microelectrodearrays in OSMcx-VLFcx simultaneously with 3D tracking of tongue and jaw kinematics using biplanar videoradiography andthe XROMM workflow (X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology) while young and old subjects engage in naturalfeeding behavior. The proposed research is significant for (1) defining cortical, biomechanical, and immunohistologicalprofiles of healthy and pathological aging, (2) determining potential contributing factors to the onset and progression ofAD, and (3) identifying cortical regions that are vulnerable to AD. Using old rhesus macaques has direct translational valueto evaluate potential avenues for pharmacological or cortical therapies for AD. The knowledge gained from the proposedstudy has important implications for earlier identification of individuals with chronic oral health issues who may be at riskfor developing AD or ARDs. It may also inform the development of more effective interventions focused on enhancing oralhealth outcomes in this group and thus preventing the onset or allaying the progression of AD or ARD.--PROJECT NARRATIVEThe link between AD and age-related oral health problems is still poorly understood because changes in the cortical andbiomechanical control of oromotor behavior in healthy aging and pathological aging have not been investigated. Theproposed research is relevant to public health because disambiguating changes in the orofacial sensorimotor-cognitiveneuronal network in healthy aging from pathological aging is expected to increase the understanding of potentialcontributing factors to the onset and progression of AD and the cortical areas that are vulnerable to AD. Thus; theproposed research is relevant to NIH?s mission of earlier identification of individuals who may be at risk for developinglate-onset AD\\/ARD and to find potential avenues for the evaluation of pharmacological or cortical therapies for AD.\"},{\"abstract\":\"ABSTRACTMany individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and\\/or mild dementia experience both cognitive deficitsand decline in motor function and postural balance. This results in an increased risk of falls. Conventional balanceprograms are not tailored for patients with cognitive impairment. Motor-cognitive exercises that are developedfor these patients can be effective, but these rehabilitation programs are underutilized. Many patients who werereferred exercise programs never attend; even fewer complete prescribed programs. For patients with cognitiveimpairment, transportation and scheduling are some of the key challenges that limit their adherence andcommitment. However, unsupervised in-home exercise programs are not adequate for these individuals becauseof poor adherence, apathy, and inability to follow exercise instructions. Therefore, there is a need for a remotely-supervised in-home exercise program for older adults with MCI and\\/or mild dementia.To address this need, we propose to develop a tele-exercise system that allows a qualified therapist to remotelysupervise and interact with the patient during goal-oriented game-like and low risk exercise tasks(TeleExergame) that have been designed to improve balance and cognition. The exercises are interactivebalance tasks with explicit goal-oriented augmented visual feedback (i.e., the patient?s movement controls avirtual object on the screen, thus providing real-time visual and audio feedback that is critical for engagementand motor learning). This is achieved by a wearable sensor worn on a body segment of interest (e.g., shin) thatmeasures body joint kinematics (e.g., position of foot\\/ankle during a virtual obstacle crossing task).For this Fast-Track submission, we conducted a preliminary study in a cohort of 22 patients with amnestic MCI,which demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed Exergame training paradigm in the target population. InPhase I, we will create the first prototype of an easy-to-use Exergame solution for in-home use that includes atelemedicine interface to assist the patient or his\\/her caregiver with sensor positioning, running the program,remote supervision, and monitoring of the patients during exercise. We will evaluate the feasibility, perception ofbenefit, and ease of use of the proposed system in the target population and focus group of therapists. In PhaseII, we will complete the development of the TeleExergame system to enable HIPAA compliant remote supervisionby a qualified therapist and provide quantitative metrics for remote monitoring and personalization of the exerciseprogram by the therapist. We will then conduct a clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of the solution.The proposed interactive tele-rehabilitation system would have an immediate and appreciable impact on patientcare by providing an interactive exercise program for individuals with MCI and\\/or mild dementia. However, MCIand dementia represent only a fraction of the potential market for the proposed technology, which could also beused in other patient populations that exhibit poor balance, such as Parkinson?s disease, diabetics, strokesurvivors with lower-extremity paresis, and older adults who cannot perform conventional exercises.--Project NarrativeThe number of older adults who suffer from motor-cognitive declines and associated increases in fall risk andfear of falling are increasing rapidly. Unfortunately; conventional balance programs are not tailored for; noreffective in patients with cognitive impairment; who also suffer from poor adherence in unsupervised settings.We propose to develop an interactive tele-rehabilitation program for adults with mild cognitive impairment or milddementia that is specifically designed to improve motor performance using comprehensive and goal-orientedlow risk exercise tasks that are remotely-supervised by a qualified therapist via a telemedicine interface.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Nearly 25% of Americans age 65+ report serious mobility problems. Mobility impairments decrease quality of life and predict increased risk of falls, disability, and mortality. However, the contribution of age-related brain changes to mobility impairments is not well understood. F99 work will examine how cortical inhibitory function relates to gait and balance declines with aging. K00 work will examine the same questions in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and test exercise as an intervention to improve cortical inhibitory function.  The sponsor's (Dr. Rachael Seidler) past work supports the novel hypothesis that declines in cortical inhibitory processes at least partially underlie motor impairments with aging. For Aim 1 (F99), the candidate is collecting two measures of lower limb cortical inhibition in 30 young and 30 older adults: 1) gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and 2) transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced cortical silent period. GABA-edited MRS provides a measure of GABA neurotransmitter concentration, while cortical silent periods provide a measure of functional cortical inhibition during muscle activity. The F99 work addresses whether these two measures of cortical inhibition are reduced in older age (Aim 1a) and whether cortical inhibition relates to individual differences in gait (Aim 1b) and balance (Aim 1c).  Mobility is often more impaired in MCI than in healthy aging. Motor symptoms typically arise much earlier than cognitive symptoms, and presence of motor symptoms relates to higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. Past work suggests that cortical inhibitory function is impaired in MCI and dementia, supporting that changes in cortical inhibition could be a component of MCI. Thus, for Aim 2 (K00), the candidate will work with Dr. Kirk Erickson to test whether cortical inhibition is reduced in MCI compared to healthy aging (Aim 2a) and if cortical inhibition relates to gait and balance in MCI (Aim 2b). Given relationships between cortical inhibition and motor control in healthy adults, it is feasible that cortical inhibition changes could also relate to mobility declines in MCI. Understanding neurotransmitter systems involved in mobility declines is important for development of interventions. Thus, the candidate will test whether aerobic exercise influences cortical inhibition in aging and MCI (Aim 2c). Past work demonstrated effects of exercise on cortical inhibition in young adults, but this has yet to be tested in aging or MCI.  This work directly contributes to the NIA's major goals of preserving mobility in aging and studying brain changes with MCI. To successfully complete these aims, the candidate will receive extensive training from an expert mentorship team in biomechanics, brain imaging, brain stimulation, MCI, and exercise intervention work. This training will provide the candidate with a comprehensive toolkit to succeed as an aging researcher, with my future independent research program focused on: 1) determining the brain changes that contribute to motor declines in older age and MCI, and 2) identifying interventions to preserve motor function in older age and MCI.--Nearly a quarter of all Americans age 65+ report serious mobility problems; and mobility problems predict greater risk of dementia; thus; preserving mobility in older age is an NIA priority. Our past work suggests that the cortical inhibitory system contributes to motor declines with aging. This proposal will test if cortical inhibition relates to individual differences in walking and balance in older age (F99) and mild cognitive impairment (K00); and whether aerobic exercise affects cortical inhibition (K00). The findings from this work could lead to the development of novel interventions to preserve mobility and prevent disability in aging and mild cognitive impairment.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Parkinson?s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative condition, with serious negative impacts on quality of life, as well as financial and personal burden on sufferers and caregivers. There remains no disease modifying therapy. PD is strongly linked to aberrant oligomerization and accumulation of alpha-synuclein (?syn) protein. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that can be isolated from vascularized tissue throughout the body and exert regenerative effects through their dynamic secretome, which is influenced by multiple factors including their microenvironment and any surrounding pathology. In this proposal, we hypothesize that by conditioning MSCs with PD-simulating stimuli, both chemical and patient-derived, we will enrich their secretome for factors which are particularly beneficial in combating ?syn-associated pathology. The potency of conditioned MSCs in targeting ?syn pathology will be assessed using biochemical and staining methods, using protein complementation, semi-native western blot and immunohistochemical analysis of oligomeric ?syn in cellular models of synucleinopathy, as well as assessing toxicity. By comparative proteomic analysis of the MSC secretome in the presence and absence of PD-simulating stimuli we will identify these beneficial secreted molecules and validate them for efficacy in alleviating ?syn-associated pathology in cellular models of synucleinopathy. For the K00 portion of this proposal, focus shifts to Alzheimer?s disease (AD), an even more common neurodegenerative condition with no meaningful therapeutic interventions. Clinical trials based on rodent studies fail to translate efficacy to human subjects, highlighting the need for physiologically relevant translatable models. Further, genetic association studies have highlighted more than 20 risk loci, usually relatively common but with moderate effect sizes. In order to mechanistically probe these different genetic risk factors in a relevant, pathology-developing model we propose to generate human brain organoids from iPSCs, gene edited to reflect various distinct genetic risk profiles. We will perform longitudinal comparative transcriptomics (RNAseq) to identify common and distinct pathways associated with the progression of pathology in these models and determine therapeutic targets which may be generalizable to AD or specific to certain genetic backgrounds.--Parkinson?s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative condition with major impacts on quality of life; no disease-modifying therapy; and mechanistic links to the toxic accumulation of a particular protein. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) release molecules that help combat disease states; with the specific molecules released influenced by their environment and surrounding pathology. By comparing what MSCs release when in conditions simulating PD with what they secrete in normal conditions; we aim to identify molecules that could be used to therapeutically target the abnormally accumulating protein in Parkinson?s disease..\"},{\"abstract\":\"Erin R. FosterR01 AG065214-01A1Prospective memory impairment in Parkinson disease-related cognitive decline: Intervention and mechanismsPROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACTParkinson disease dementia (PDD) ? one of the Alzheimer?s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) ? is associated with increased disability, mortality and healthcare costs among people with PD. The long term goal of this research is to reduce disability and delay the onset of the ADRD PDD by enabling people at risk for PDD to cope with cognitive decline to maintain daily function. Existing medical (e.g. surgical, pharmacological) treatments for PD do not prevent or treat cognitive impairment, so behavioral interventions that mitigate its negative functional consequences and potentially delay or slow PDD are a top research priority. Unfortunately, the widely-used process training approach to cognitive intervention (repetitive practice of tasks designed to challenge and improve particular cognitive functions) has been unsuccessful in improving daily function and quality of life in this population. To overcome this limitation, the investigators take a strategy training approach, teaching targeted strategies that people can use in their everyday lives to circumvent cognitive deficits and accomplish daily tasks. Strategy training is a practice standard for cognitive rehabilitation in brain injury and stroke, but its application to PDD is novel. Moreover, the strategy training intervention developed for this study explicitly focuses on generalization of training to daily function, an aspect that is critically lacking from many typical strategy training approaches and from PD-related cognitive intervention research to date. This project addresses prospective memory, or the ability to remember to execute delayed intentions at the appropriate moment in the future. Good prospective memory is essential for independent living (e.g. paying bills, turning the stove off), employment, social relationships, and compliance with important health behaviors (e.g. taking medications). People at risk for PDD have prospective memory deficits that relate to worse daily function and quality of life. Therefore, prospective memory impairment is a relevant cognitive problem to address in this population. The primary objective of the current project is to determine the efficacy of mechanistically-targeted strategy training on prospective memory among people at risk for PDD (those with PD-related mild cognitive impairment; PD-MCI). It is a single-blind randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of strategy training to the traditional process training approach on objective laboratory prospective memory performance (Aim 1) and reported everyday prospective memory function (Aim 2). Additional objectives are to investigate neural mechanisms of prospective memory impairment in PD-MCI (Aim 3) and neural and behavioral predictors of prospective memory training response (Aim 4). This project leverages participants, data and infrastructure from an existing longitudinal cohort of PD, PD-MCI, PDD and control participants to evaluate short-term and long-term training effects, neurobiological mechanisms, and predictors of treatment response. This work will meet the pressing need for effective cognitive interventions that delay functional impairment associated with the ADRD PDD and will positively impact function and quality of life in this population.--PROJECT NARRATIVECognitive decline in Parkinson disease (PD) causes disability and reduced quality of life. Current medicaltreatments do not prevent or treat cognitive decline in PD; so behavioral interventions that mitigate its negativefunctional consequences and thus potentially delay the onset of dementia are in high demand. This study willtest the efficacy of a targeted training approach for improving cognition and daily function in people with PDand may ultimately result in enhanced independence and quality of life for this population.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARYThe natural process of aging is also the leading risk factor for Alzheimer?s disease (AD), a prevalent form ofdementia that has devastating effects on the quality of human life and health care costs. As cognitive functionsprogressively deteriorate with AD, a neurobiological understanding of how AD alters brain cells and their circuitfunctions is one of the great challenges facing modern biomedical research with broad implications foradvancing the nation?s health as well as stimulating the economy. Considerable human and animal ADresearch has focused on relating ?physical? (macroscopic, microscopic) changes in the brain with destructiveloss of memory (i.e., anterograde and retrograde amnesias). In contrast, significantly less is known about theimpact of AD on other cognitive functioning, such as risky decision-making which plays pervasive role in dailylife, and how AD-afflicted neurons operate in ?real-time? as cognitive functioning is taking place. The primarygoal of this application is to understand the dynamics of prelimbic cortex-hippocampus (PL-HPC) circuitfunctions in decision-making in a murine model of AD, utilizing an ecologically-relevant behavioral paradigm.We will test the general hypothesis that AD causes coordinated PL-HPC neural activities and risky decision-making abilities to decline as a function of the amyloid plaque accumulation in the two structures. There aretwo specific aims of the project: (1) an ETHOBEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS will investigate the scope of amyloid plaqueeffects on the animal?s ability to discern safety-danger boundary and make optimal risky foraging decisions;and (2) a SYSTEMS-LEVEL ANALYSIS will determine the neural synchrony in the PL-HPC network as AD miceperform risky foraging and also probe whether decision-making deficits can be alleviated by optogeneticintervention. Information generated from this project would be of significance (1) from a basic scientificperspective because it will provide novel data pertaining to AD-associated changes neural coding anddecision-making; and (2) from an applied perspective because it provides a new avenue of naturalistic-basedpreclinical research that can potentially lead to developing successful treatments of AD-related declines incognitive functions.--PROJECT NARRATIVEWhile much research on Alzheimer?s disease (AD) has focused on ?physical? neuropathological markers (i.e.;plaques and tangles) in the brain and consequent loss of memory functions; there is very limited information asto how AD adversely affects brain cell activities in ?real-time? during cognitive functions. Thus; this project willinvestigate how the neural coding in the cortico-limbic (i.e.; prelimbic cortex-hippocampus) network; whichplays important role in risky decision-making; is altered by amyloid pathology in a well-characterized AD mousemodel (i.e. 5XFAD). Data generated from this project will fill important gaps in the AD field; stimulate futureresearch; and provide deeper insights into understanding this devastating neurodegenerative disease thatprofoundly impact the quality of human life and the nation?s economy in today?s increasingly long-living society.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary\\/AbstractThe number of elderly individuals over 65 years of age is projected to increase exponentially over the nextseveral decades. Neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer?s and dementia are expected to pose asignificant health and financial concern for aging individuals, their families, and society. In order to therapeuticallycombat neurodegenerative diseases, we have to understand age-associated alterations and delineate themechanisms causing cognitive deficiency. Cognitive impairment in the form of reduced executive function,including attentional abilities and cognitive flexibility, is a characteristic of several psychiatric andneurodegenerative diseases as well as of cognitive aging. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)hypofunction contributes to impaired attention in schizophrenia. Furthermore, electrophysiological evidence hasshown that NMDAR hypofunction in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) emerges during middle age and isassociated with a decline in attentional ability. Results indicate that like older humans, serine racemase RNA(SRR) declines in the mPFC of older rats with impaired cognition. Serine racemase generates D-serine, a co-agonist that regulates NMDAR function. The overall goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that enhancingNMDAR function through 1) upregulation of the GluN2B NMDAR subunit or 2) increased expression of SRR, inthe mPFC, will restore NMDAR-mediated synaptic function and ameliorate attention and cognitive flexibility. Aim1 will test the hypothesis that upregulation of the GluN2B subunit of NMDAR in the mPFC will restore NMDAR-mediated synaptic function and improve cognitive function. By employing specific expression vectors, we willlimit the expression of the GluN2B subunit of NMDAR either to mPFC pyramidal neurons alone or in conjunctionwith interneurons. Behavioral performance of animals will be tested on the 5-choice serial reaction time task andthe set-shifting task, and upregulation will be confirmed using electrophysiological, immunohistochemical,Western blotting, and RT-qPCR analyses. It is predicted that upregulation of GluN2B expression in the mPFCwill restore NMDAR-mediated synaptic function and improve executive function. Aim 2 will test the hypothesisthat a viral vector mediated increase in the expression of serine racemase, specific to pyramidal neurons orastrocytes will enhance NMDAR function and reverse cognitive deficits associated with senescence. Augmentedexpression, specific to pyramidal cells or astrocytes in the mPFC will be confirmed. We predict that upregulationof serine racemase will enhance NMDAR function and ameliorate attention and cognitive flexibility. The proposedstudies will employ an array of powerful multidisciplinary techniques to modify specific components of mPFCcircuitry testing two novel and independent hypothesis both directed at improving age-related cognitivedysfunction.--Project NarrativeAttention is vital for daily functioning and even a moderate loss in attentional capacities may have detrimentalconsequences for the aging population. Aging is a complex process and is a major risk factor forneurodegenerative diseases. Age-associated cognitive deficits are linked to a decrease in N-methyl-D-aspartatereceptor (NMDAR) function.

Even more individuals will experience normal age-related cognitivedecline, including mild cognitive impairments and memory deficits. Understanding the molecular mechanismsthat underlie these impairments is a key step toward developing treatments to prevent or reverse memory declinein both normal aging and Alzheimer?s disease. One hallmark of age-related cognitive decline is an impairmentin memory updating, the ability to modify existing memories with new information. Memories do not persist in afixed, unalterable state, but instead must be capable of being updated in response to new, relevant experiences.Indeed, most memories are updates to existing memories, rather than brand new associations. Despite itsfundamental importance, little is known about the mechanisms that support memory updating and even less isunderstood about how these mechanisms are altered with age. To address this, we have developed a novelparadigm called the Objects in Updated Locations (OUL) task that is ideal for studying memory updating in bothyoung and old rodents. In this proposal, we will examine the role of a key epigenetic mechanism, histonedeacetylase 3 (HDAC3), in regulating gene expression during memory updating in the young and old brain.HDAC3 is a powerful enzyme that promotes a repressive chromatin structure to limit gene expression. Deletionor disruption of HDAC3 in the young brain transforms a subthreshold learning event into one that produces robustmemory. Further, deleting HDAC3 in the dorsal hippocampus of old mice ameliorates age-related impairmentsin spatial memory formation. To date, no studies have tested the role of HDAC3 in memory updating or age-related impairments in memory updating. Here, we hypothesize that aberrant HDAC3 function in the old braincontributes to a repressive chromatin structure that disrupts the gene expression necessary for memoryupdating. In support of this hypothesis, our preliminary data show that pharmacological HDAC3 inhibition canameliorate age-related memory updating impairments. To fully test this hypothesis, we propose two aims. In Aim1, we will test the role of HDAC3 in age-related impairments in memory updating using a combination ofpharmacological and viral CRISPR-based inhibition of HDAC3 selectively during a memory update. In Aim 2, wewill use next generation sequencing including chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing and RNAsequencing to identify the molecular mechanisms that underlie memory updating and determine how HDAC3contributes to age-related impairments in this process. Our results will elucidate the mechanisms that supportmemory updating and identify HDAC3 as a critical regulator of memory updating in the young and old brain.These results represent a significant conceptual advance in our understanding of age-related memory declineand may identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention to improve cognition in old age.--Project Narrative:Alzheimer?s disease is expected to affect 13.8 million people over the age of 65 by 2030 and even moreindividuals will experience normal age-related cognitive impairments and memory decline.

The single greatest risk factor for cognitive declineand AD is aging, yet we lack an understanding of how aging predisposes the brain to these consequences.Synaptic alterations that correlate with cognitive dysfunction are prevalent in both normal and pathologicalaging, though they are distinct from one another. In normal aging, subtle synaptic changes that affect thenumber of functional glutamatergic receptors lead to a decrease in synaptic efficacy and result in cognitivedecline. In AD, synaptic loss precedes cell death and is the neuropathological feature of AD that correlatesmost strongly with cognitive dysfunction. Synaptic changes are unmistakably an important feature of normalaging and pathological neurodegeneration, and the clear links to cognitive decline underscore the importanceof simultaneously investigating these features of aging. Non-human primates (NHPs) have similarneuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and cognitive abilities to humans, and also can develop the hallmarkneuropathologies of AD; Tau tangles and ?-amyloid plaques. The proposed research develops the commonmarmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a NHP model for simultaneously investigating aging-related cognitive declineand synaptic alterations. Compared to macaque monkeys with long lifespans (25-40 years), marmosets have arelatively short average lifespan of 9-10 years, enabling their use in longitudinal studies of aging. In Aim 1,aging-related deficits in marmosets? performance of a hippocampus-dependent memory task, the DelayedRecognition Span Task (DRST), will be determined. Performance of this task declines with normal aging inhumans and macaques and patients with mild AD are further impaired on the DRST compared to healthyelderly controls. This task has been developed for marmosets using an automated touch screen system withinthe animal?s home cage. This Aim will test the hypothesis that aged animals exhibit impaired memory capacityon the task, reflecting aging-related cognitive decline. In Aim 2, non-invasive positron emission tomography(PET) imaging will be used to measure synaptic alterations in the hippocampus of the marmosets used forcognitive testing in Aim 1. To do this, a PET tracer that selectively binds to AMPA receptors will be used. ThisAim will test the hypothesis that aged marmosets have decreased tracer uptake in the hippocampus, reflectingdecreased AMPA receptor density, compared to younger animals. Further, there will be a strong, positivecorrelation between AMPA receptor density and cognitive performance, measured via the DRST in Aim 1.Establishing this experimental platform for the simultaneous tracking of aging-related changes in bothhippocampal-dependent memory and AMPA receptor density will enable future longitudinal investigations toelucidate the time course of synaptic changes and cognitive decline in the brains of marmosets.

However, there is a large gap between this kind of memory and memory as it is usuallystudied in the psychological and neuroscientific laboratory, by presenting people with disconnectedwords, pictures, or sentences. Recent empirical and theoretical results have identified specialized neural and computationalmechanisms that segment ongoing activity into meaningful events and have shown that thesemechanisms are important for memory formation. In this proposal, we describe a novel synthesis andextension of previous approaches to the effects of age and AD on memory, based on theseinnovations. This synthesis opens up an opportunity to better understand how the mechanisms ofhuman memory encoding change with age and AD, and at the same time to test the potential of novelinterventions for potential clinical application to memory improvement.

We propose to examine detailed AD-relatedneural circuit mechanisms that will be critical for developing new AD treatment strategies by use of twocomplementary AD mouse models, which share many features of human AD. Our guiding hypothesis is thatAD-related neurodegeneration causes maladaptive changes of memory circuit connections and neural ensembleactivities in the hippocampus. We discovered recently in the mouse that non-canonical subicular back-projections to hippocampal CA1 underlie object-place learning, a prominent impairment in AD. This circuit hasbeen recently identified in human brain. We will test our hypothesis that significant impairments in bidirectionalinformation processing between hippocampal CA1 and the subiculum (SUB) develop over time during ADprogression. In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of AD-like neurodegeneration on local and global circuitconnections to hippocampal CA1 and SUB excitatory neurons. We will map and compare circuit inputconnections and output projections of excitatory CA1 and SUB neurons in adult control, and AD-like mice usingretrograde monosynaptic rabies tracing and anterograde monosynaptic herpes simplex virus (HSV) tracing.Further, we will perform experiments in postmortem human hippocampus of aged-matched control and ADpatients to map the SUB-CA1 pathway in human brains and understand detailed changes of this brain circuit inAD patients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that neurodegeneration in AD-like mice degrades object-location memory encoded by hippocampal CA1 and SUB excitatory neurons. To map neuronal activity tobehavioral performance, we will use in vivo miniature microscopic imaging to examine and compare spatialrepresentations of CA1 excitatory neurons and SUB excitatory neurons during open-field exploration, track-based route-running and object-location memory tasks. Thus, we can longitudinally track progressive AD-likefunctional defects.

This aging has occurred in part because modern medicine has identified risk factorsand treatments for many other diseases, but not for AD. Thus there is a great and unmet need to do so. Ahallmark symptom of AD and aging without dementia is impaired memory, including retrieval. Further, some ofthe earliest neuropathology found in AD is within the systems that provide the neuromodulators dopamine (DA)and norepinephrine (NE) to the brain (including the hippocampus, a center for declarative\\/episodic memory).The largest brainstem adrenergic nucleus is the locus coeruleus (LC), which supplies all of the NE and asubstantial portion of the DA found in the dorsal hippocampus. The LC can also be affected in normal aging.As such, the goal of this proposal is to better understand the roles and mechanisms by which LC-derived DAand NE modulate the encoding and retrieval of declarative\\/episodic memory. Toward this goal, pharmacologicand genetic manipulations will be performed in rodents, for which there are excellent behavioral paradigms thatrely on hippocampus-dependent memory. Our preliminary studies indicate that all three ?-adrenergic receptorsthat are activated by NE play a critical role in the hippocampus to promote memory retrieval. They also suggestthat adrenergic DA is required for hippocampus-dependent memory. Thus the first aim will examine themolecular and cellular mechanisms by which ?-adrenergic receptors promote hippocampus-dependent memoryusing combined pharmacologic and genetic approaches. Subcellular localization of ? receptors in thehippocampus will also be determined. The second aim will examine the modulation of hippocampus-dependentmemory by ?adrenergic? DA using combined pharmacologic and genetic approaches. The third aim will examinethe ability of drugs that enhance DA and NE signaling to promote memory in models of AD and aging. Thecompletion of these aims will provide a better understanding of how memory encoding and retrieval is facilitatedwithin the hippocampus, and ultimately may suggest potential targets for enhancing memory in AD and aging.--NARRATIVEMemory impairment that includes encoding and retrieval is a hallmark symptom of Alzheimer?s disease (AD).Impairment of memory retrieval also occurs during aging in the absence of dementia. One of the earliest signsof pathology associated with AD is found in the locus coeruleus (LC); the largest nucleus that utilizes thecombined neuromodulators norepinephrine and dopamine. The LC can also exhibit decline in normal aging.The studies proposed herein will greatly extend our understanding of the neuromodulatory mechanisms engagedby LC-derived dopamine and norepinephrine that underlie hippocampus-dependent memory. They will alsoexamine the ability of drugs that modulate the activity of these neuromodulators to reverse memory deficits inmouse models of AD and in aged mice without dementia; with the goal of identifying novel therapeutics.\"},{\"abstract\":\"I'm a clinical psychologist and researcher, Penn Memory Center Scholar, and instructor in the Division ofGeriatric Medicine at University of Pennsylvania.

In the future, persons withpreclinical AD will be prescribed therapies and other interventions to delay or slow the disease progression.

The career development plan comprises a complementaryset of training and research activities to support the candidate?s transition to independence. Specific traininggoals include: 1) to develop expertise in using electroencephalography (EEG) to assess brain networkdynamics in aging populations; 2) to increase depth of knowledge of functional neuroanatomy, with a focus onfrontal networks compromised early in the course of AD; 3) to gain specialized training in clinical researchdesign and statistics, with an emphasis on dimension reduction and analysis of complex data; and 4) to receiveformal mentorship in professional development. The training plan draws on an exemplary interdisciplinary teamwith expertise in the electroencephalography (S.

Training activities will take place through formal mentorship, experiential laboratory training,didactics, and the completion of a rigorous research project. The scientific objective of the research project isto investigate behavioral and electrophysiological markers of frontal control network integrity that may serve asnovel markers of risk for and resilience to AD-associated cognitive decline. Each research aim corresponds toa complementary area of training. Specific aims include 1) to examine behavioral and electrophysiologicalmarkers of frontal network dynamics in older adults at risk for AD; 2) to validate the behavioral andelectrophysiological markers using independent measures of frontal network integrity (i.e., magnetic resonanceimaging); and 3) to validate the markers as indices of cognitive resilience.

Unfortunately, few studies have testedthe direct influence of AD pathology on spatial computation within affected neuronal populations, resulting in aninformation gap at the neuronal network level. Moreover, in vivo experiments that examine large scale, neuronalnetwork activity in mouse models of A? and tau pathology are lacking. In this proposal, I test the overarchinghypothesis that A? and tau associated neuronal network dysfunction impairs task-relevant, spatialinformation encoding in large populations of neurons within the EC-HIPP circuit, and that combatingthis aberrant activity can restore order and improve spatial information processing in AD mice. In Aim 1,I will test the hypothesis that oligomeric forms of A? and tau disturb spatial information content encoded withinlarge populations of neurons in the entorhinal cortex ? hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit. I will also test if theseoligomeric peptides alter the number of neurons recruited into the population code responsible for memoryencoding in a spatial learning and memory task. In Aims 2 & 3, I will leverage the predictive power of machinelearning to decipher the neural code for spatial information processing in EC-HIPP population activity.Specifically, my goals in Aim 2 will be to examine the individual and combined impact of A? and tau pathologieson features of spatial information encoding in the EC-Tau\\/hAPP mouse line. In Aim 3, I will employchemogenetics using a novel DREADDs ligand to combat aberrant neuronal activity in AD mouse models, withthe ultimate goal of improving spatial information processing in neuronal networks burdened with pathology.Excitatory neurons will be specifically targeted in an effort to better understand their contribution to impairedspatial information processing in AD mouse models. The proposed research aims are designed to bridge an information gap between AD-related cognitiveimpairment and the underlying circuit pathology. This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Awardwill afford me the opportunity to accomplish this major goal while enriching my technical skillset and expandingmy knowledge of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the integrated training and mentorship that I will receive willhelp me develop additional expertise in machine learning for spatial decoding analyses. Together, the proposedstudies and career development plan will ensure that I achieve my long-term career goal of launching acompetitive, independent research career at a major research university.--Project NarrativeThe progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (A?) and tau pathology in Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is associatedwith dysfunctional neuronal signaling and poor cognitive performance. In this proposal; newly developedmachine learning strategies will be used to decode features of task-relevant; spatial information from neuralensemble activity in the entorhinal cortex ? hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit of transgenic mice expressing A? andtau pathology; with the overarching goal of understanding how A? and tau interfere with spatial informationencoded within neuronal networks. Dysfunctional neuronal populations will then be selectively targeted usingchemogenetics to correct their aberrant firing patterns; with the aim of improving the quality of spatial informationcarried by pathology afflicted neuronal networks.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACT This K01 award will be integral in the development of my career plan designed to extend my prior trainingin nutrition and nutrition interventions to include skills in clinical assessment of dementia, Alzheimer?s disease(AD) research methods, cognitive theory and assessment, and metabolism themed MR neuroimaging tools.My previous training briefly introduced me to AD research and confirmed that I am passionate about a careerin AD. Nutrition research in AD is a young and promising field that will require nutrition experts to gainextensive training to understand AD and its assessment tools. To this end, I?ve assembled an expert mentorand advisory committee to provide formal training in AD clinical assessment, cognition, and MR neuroimaging. I was appointed as an Assistant Professor on the Tenure Track in the KUMC Department of Dietetics andNutrition on September 22, 2019. I will take advantage of KUMC?s interdisciplinary culture and train under thementorship of Drs. Jeff Burns, Munro Cullum, and William Brooks. This will allow me to capitalize on several ofKUMC?s research strengths: the NIH-designated KU Alzheimer?s Disease Center (ADC), Hoglund BrainImaging Center, KUMC Department of Dietetics and Nutrition, and the Clinical and Translational Science Unit(funded through an NIH CTSA). Dr. Cullum will provide valuable external institutional training in AD researchand cognition at UT Southwestern in Dallas, TX. The proposed K01 training will add to my well-developednutrition skillset and forge a path toward my overall goal to establish research independence in the field ofNutritional Cognitive Neuroscience applying nutrition interventions and the neuroimaging and cognitive toolslearned in this K01 to AD research. The scientific goals of this project are to build upon my doctoral research investigating nutrition?s role inAD risk. This is a growing field as current treatments for the disease are relatively ineffective and means forpreventing its development are highly sought after. I propose to build off of my previous work showing highglycemic diet?s relationship with brain amyloid and investigate its relationship with AD risk using the toolsacquired from the training in this K01. Aim 1 will leverage a clinical cohort (P30 AG035982) of over 450 participants at the University of KansasAlzheimer?s Disease Center (KU ADC). This aim seeks to investigate the cross-sectional relationship of highglycemic diet with cognition and MR-derived brain structure and blood flow in older adults with and without AD. Aim 2 will leverage an NIA-funded R01 (AG060157-01) study at KUMC investigating the role ofMediterranean diet vs. low-fat diet interventions in AD prevention. The goal of this aim is to investigate whetherintervention-related changes in high glycemic diet explain changes in cognition and MR-derived brain structureand metabolic profile. This aim will also explore whether the relationship between high glycemic diet and brainhealth outcomes is mediated by changes in glucoregulation, as assessed by insulin resistance scores.--PROJECT NARRATIVEDiet is known to affect glucose metabolism and insulin resistance and a growing body of evidence suggeststhat impairments to the status of these processes poses increased risk of Alzheimer?s disease andprogression. The aim of this research is to investigate the role of high glycemic diet?s relationship withAlzheimer?s risk and prognosis in older adults. This research could lead the way to inform dietaryrecommendations for achieving optimal brain health; potentially affecting the lives and well-being of many.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary\\/Abstract Aging changes the adult brain both structurally and functionally.

I propose to carry outlongitudinal electrophysiology and behavioral studies to understand how age-related changes in individualneurons and their circuits contribute to cognitive impairments in mouse models of aging and Alzheimer?s disease.I plan to take advantage of a novel biotechnology, mesh electronics, that will overcome many previous challengespreventing the study of aging processes of single neurons and their circuits. I will use this technology combinedwith behavioral tasks in virtual reality to understand how neurons and their circuits within the hippocampus andentorhinal cortex change with normal aging and lead to cognitive decline. Then I will perform similar studies tounderstand how spatial memory and learning deficits arise in a model of early aging in Alzheimer?s disease thatexpresses pathological tau, with the goal of determining if either soluble or aggregated tau leads to neuronaldysfunction and spatial memory impairment or if they arise coincidentally. These data will be extremely valuablefor the medical community as aggregated tau is currently the target of several ongoing clinical trials. Theseexperiments will also establish mesh electronics as a useful tool for the study of normal and pathological agingthat could be extended to understand the onset of cognitive decline in many other model systems.--Project NarrativeThese experiments will provide insight into processes that contribute to cognitive decline with aging andAlzheimer?s disease. I will look at how neurons and their circuits change with age and try to determine whichfeatures are harmful and which features are coincidental.

Mild cognitive impairmentand dementia are prevalent in the elderly population, and even normal aging causes subtle decline in episodicmemory, making normal cognitive aging arguably the most widespread mental health issue in the developedworld. Spatial memory is an integral component of episodic memory and is particularly impacted by aging, butthe causes behind this deficit are unknown. Without understanding the mechanisms behind age-related spatialmemory decline, society will lack the means to overcome this obstacle to healthy aging or mitigate potentialrisk factors for more serious disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. This proposal will pursue two possiblefactors related to spatial memory dysfunction in a mouse model of aging and its conclusions could helptranslate to potential avenues of intervention in humans. Preliminary data from the Cai lab and published datahas shown that, in CA1 of the hippocampus, cellular excitability and the transcription factor cAMP responseelement binding protein (CREB) are reduced in aged rodents, impacting memory function. In theseexperiments, increasing CA1 excitability and CREB expression ameliorated the memory deficits of theseanimals. However, these studies were unable to verify whether the underlying neural memory representationswere improved by those manipulations. The overarching goal of this proposal is determine whether increasingCA1 cellular excitability and CREB can restore spatial memory and neural representations to young-like levels.In the first aim, I will use designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to increaseexcitation coming into CA1 pyramidal cells in aged mice. Simultaneously, I will perform in vivo calcium imagingduring running on different linear tracks with specific reward locations for each track to quantify the accuracy ofneural spatial representations and spatial memory. In the second aim, I will use a viral approach tooverexpress CREB in CA1 pyramidal cells of aged mice while performing calcium imaging on the same task.The findings from these aims will allow me to conclude whether increasing CA1 excitability or CREB canimprove spatial memory representations and deficits that arise from aging. By combining chemogenetics, viralmanipulations of protein expression, and in vivo imaging, this proposal will illuminate the neural mechanismsbehind age-related spatial memory decline.--Project Narrative As quality of life continues to improve in the United States; the elderly population continues to grow;and with it; the number of patients afflicted by memory deficits from normal aging. Using state-of-the-art in vivocalcium imaging; in vivo chemogenetics; and genetic manipulation of protein expression; the projects in thisproposal will test possible methods of intervention for restoring young-like spatial memory function to agedrodents. These experiments will conclude whether manipulating cellular excitability or a plasticity-relatedprotein called CREB is sufficient to restore spatial memory and coding in the aged hippocampus.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project SummaryMemories are crucial to our lives. With them, we generate a unique history, connect with the world around us,and make informed decisions. Memory loss occurs as we get older, and more pervasive changes in memoryfunction can be among the earliest signs of Alzheimer?s disease, a major public health challenge affecting morethan 5.6 million Americans. Past studies have shown that the ability to discriminate among similar mnemonicexperiences (i.e. pattern separation) is an early sign of memory impairment in older adults at risk for Alzheimer?sdisease. This disruption in memory is thought to be an early harbinger of subsequent cognitive decline and maybe a suitable therapeutic target in the earliest stages of the disease. However, such targeting is impossiblewithout a complete understanding of the circuit-level dynamics that support pattern separation in humans. Whilecomputational theories have long suggested a necessary role for interactions between the hippocampus and theneocortex, the field has struggled with challenges in identifying such network level dynamics in humans due tolimited temporal resolution using fMRI and limited spatial resolution using EEG. I propose to fill this gap inknowledge using a rare and unique opportunity to record from both the neocortex and the hippocampus withsuperior spatial and temporal resolution in humans implanted with intracranial electrodes for clinical monitoringwhile they engage in a pattern separation memory task. I will collect neural recording data from a minimum of15 patients undergoing clinical monitoring with surgically implanted depth electrodes in the hippocampus andthe neocortex at the UCI Comprehensive Epilepsy Unit. I propose three specific aims: (1) Test the hypothesisthat increased theta power in the hippocampus and neocortex will predict successful discrimination performanceon pattern separation task; (2) Test the hypothesis that during encoding, hippocampal-neocortical interactionswill be directionally biased such that the hippocampus leads the cortex, reflecting the integration of newly learnedinformation into neocortical sites; and (3) Test the hypothesis that during retrieval, hippocampal-neocorticalinteractions will be directionally biased such that the cortex leads the hippocampus, reflecting the access ofmemory content from neocortical sites. The proposed studies are feasible with the excellent research andtraining environment at UC Irvine and the availability of clinical infrastructure and an epilepsy monitoring unit withresearch-dedicated recording equipment. Using these resources, I have already collected preliminary data insupport of all three hypotheses. With the joint mentorship of Dr. Michael Yassa and Dr. Jack Lin, I will receiveadvanced training in clinical and cognitive neuroscience. With additional mentorship of Dr. Lee Swindlehurst inelectrical engineering, I am employing techniques to analyze high dimensional data and directionality measuresfor network analysis. With the help of this constellation of mentors, I aim to fill a critical gap in knowledge aboutmemory mechanisms in the human brain, with the overarching goal of applying this knowledge to reversingmemory loss in aging and Alzheimer?s disease.--Project NarrativeAlzheimer?s disease is a devastating illness affecting more than 5.8 million Americans; and with the world?spopulation rapidly aging; the public health and economic impact of Alzheimer?s disease is enormous. Memoryimpairment is the first sign of cognitive change in Alzheimer?s disease; but we still do not have a goodunderstanding of the mechanisms by which these memory processes may be impacted.

Longitudinal assessments are necessaryto monitor cognitive change. However, studies that involve repeated testing are subject to practice effects,which are typically defined as improvements in scores because of prior test exposure. Practice effects areimportant for studies of aging because they inflate performance, thereby obscuring the true degree of age-related cognitive decline expected at mid- and late life. If uncorrected for practice effects, stable performance ina longitudinal study may indicate cognitive decline that would go undetected based on typical norm-basedclassifications of impairment. Although cognitive decline is a likely a continuous process, cut points forimpairment are necessary for determining when to alter patient care and when to enroll subjects in a study. Cutpoints for cognitive impairment, like cut points for biomarkers, are set because individuals with that level ofperformance are more likely to have other symptoms or a greater likelihood for disease progression. Themisclassification of cognitive change may also obscure the relationship between cognition and biomarkers orrisk factors for AD. Nevertheless, researchers almost always utilize uncorrected data, rely on purely statisticalmethods of practice effect correction, or simply covary for the number of visits. To directly address practiceeffects across two timepoints, a better method is to include replacement subjects who are naive to the tests,but age- and demographically-matched to returnees. Using this method, the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging(VETSA), demonstrated practice effects after six years, even when mean performance declined with age.Moreover, practice effect correction doubled the percentage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnoseswhile reducing the number of participants who reverted to normal. In this proposal I will extend this approach topractice effect correction by, for the first time, applying it across more than two assessments. Data will be fromthe VETSA and the Alzheimer?s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which differ in participant age, retestinterval, biomarkers, and number of assessments. I now have pilot data on the identification of ?pseudo?replacement subjects in ADNI. The method will be developed within ANDI and cross-validated in VETSA,which recruited ?true? replacement subjects. I hypothesize that accounting for practice effects will lead to earlierdiagnoses of MCI, and a stronger signal between cognitive performance and biomarkers. With earlier detectionof MCI, researchers and clinicians will be better able to track AD progression and monitor the effectiveness ofpotential treatments. Beyond the current proposal, a longer-term goal is to develop normative practice effectdata (e.g., with NIH toolbox). By promoting earlier detection of cognitive decline and progression to AD-relateddisorders, normative practice effect data would have substantial nationwide public health implications.--NARRATIVELongitudinal studies of cognition are necessary for determining deterioration to Alzheimer?s-related disorders;and for fully understanding associations between early cognitive change and Alzheimer?s biomarkers or riskfactors. Practice effects are apparent in a jump in later scores on repeated cognitive assessments; which mayobscure progression to Alzheimer?s-related disorders and the relationship between cognition and biomarkers orrisk factors. This proposal aims to develop a practice effect correction method for use when there are morethan two assessments and an expected decline in cognitive ability over time.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACTAging persons living with HIV (PLHIV) are now at risk of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such asAlzheimer?s disease (AD) and its precursor amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Due to the potential forcompounding effects of HIV and aging on the brain, as well as high rates of medical conditions (e.g., chronicinflammation) that are risk factors for AD, PLHIV are likely at higher risk for neurodegenerative diseases suchas AD. Identifying PLHIV with aMCI is complicated because the defining characteristic of aMCI, memorydysfunction, is also common in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), which are still prevalent in thecART era (30-50%), particularly among older PLHIV. In order to provide early, targeted interventions and predictcognitive impairment progression, it is imperative that clinicians are able to accurately differentiate HAND andaMCI. However, because this aging trend is relatively recent, there is a paucity of research aimed atdisentangling HAND and aMCI. Due to differences in underlying brain changes, memory dysfunction presentsdifferently on neurocognitive testing in HAND versus aMCI. Specifically, HAND (more prefrontally- andsubcortically-based) is characterized by impairment in recall but relatively preserved recognition performance onneurocognitive tests, whereas aMCI (associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy) is characterized byimpairment in both recall and recognition. Therefore, recognition may be a clinically-useful neurocognitive markerto differentiate HAND and aMCI. To-date, the majority of HIV neurocognitive studies have preferentially focusedon recall deficits and have not examined recognition. Research is needed to assess the clinical utility ofrecognition in disentangling aMCI and HAND by examining if recognition correlates with neuroanatomicalstructures associated with aMCI. This F31 research project therefore aims to 1) examine neuroanatomicalcorrelates of recall and recognition, and 2) examine if structural integrity of the medial temporal lobe is associatedwith future amnestic decline (i.e., decline in recall and recognition performance) among older PLHIV. Additionally,exploratory analyses will probe biological mechanisms that put PLHIV at greater risk of aMCI by examining therole of peripheral inflammation in memory impairment and brain integrity. This project will utilize longitudinal,archival neuroimaging and neuropsychological data collected from the CNS HIV Antiretroviral Therapy EffectsResearch (CHARTER) program. Finally, the training opportunities afforded by the F31 funding mechanism willfacilitate the applicant?s long-term goal of becoming an independent academic neuropsychologist dedicated toimproving detection of age-related neurocognitive decline in clinically-diverse, at-risk populations.--PROJECT NARRATIVELittle is known about the biological markers associated with Alzheimer?s disease (AD) risk among middle-agedand older persons living with HIV.

Neuroimaging research has separately related age-related declines in AM to increased neural activity in the hippocampus and lower integrity of white matter tracts directly emanating from the hippocampus (e.g., fornix). However, very few aging studies have assessed interactions between these functional and structural neural substrates and none have done so in relation to AM. In addition, because most prior AM research has used paradigms that involve remembering at most only pairs of stimuli, the effect of aging on more demanding associations remains unknown. Neurocognitive aging theories predict that older adults cannot recruit sufficient neural resources under more demanding cognitive loads, leading to lower neural activity and poorer cognitive performance than younger adults. Whereas this theory has mainly been tested with working memory paradigms and in relation to neural activity, it follows that a similar mechanism may underlie effects of AM load, and that the behavioral and neural responses may be mediated by brain structure. To address these limitations, we propose to characterize age differences in AM and the functional and structural neural substrates of AM as a function of Associative Load. Forty younger and 40 older healthy adults will perform an AM task with word pairs (low load) and triplets (high load) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisition followed by a multicompartment diffusion imaging (MDI) sequence. We will assess age group differences in hippocampal activity during low and high load conditions using fMRI (Specific Aim 1) and in fornix integrity using MDI (Specific Aim 2), and how these neural substrates individually relate to AM performance. To test our novel hypothesis that the neural response to AM load is constrained by white matter structural integrity, we further propose to explore the moderating effects of age group and AM load on the direct relationship between hippocampal activity and fornix integrity (Specific Aim 3). In addition to advancing our understanding of AM deficits in healthy aging and the contribution of the fornix and hippocampus to memory performance, this proposal will support the applicant\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s training aims of learning additional theoretical (e.g., cognitive neuroscience of aging), statistical (e.g., univariate and multivariate approaches), and methodological (e.g., advanced diffusion imaging) skills.

Currently, 2\\/3 of people with dementia live inlow and middle-income countries (LMIC). 30% of dementia cases are preventable by modifying risk factors suchas low education. Formal education acquired early in life protects against dementia, but whether acquiringeducation later in life can decrease dementia risk is less clear. Our previous cross-sectional work conducted inBrazil\\/UFMG in partnership with the USA\\/UCSF suggests that even few years of education might improve brainresilience by strengthening the relationship between episodic memory and medial temporal lobe structures,including the hippocampus (HC) and its connections.

Although the advent of Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s disease (AD) biomarkers has revolutionized our understanding of AD pathogenesis during the preclinical phase, these approaches are often expensive, invasive, inaccessible due to rural location, cost, or medical contraindications. Additionally, beyond a focus on AD biomarkers alone, it is essential to emphasize that cognitive difficulties and subsequent functional impairment are the features of the disease that negatively impact the lives of patients and their families. Emerging evidence suggests that subtle cognitive changes may develop much earlier than originally described in models of AD and these subtle cognitive changes add meaningful prognostic value, above and beyond AD biomarkers, in predicting progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. The gold standard approach for identifying subtle cognitive decline in preclinical AD, however, remains unclear. Therefore, we propose to apply four different classification algorithms for subtle cognitive decline in the open source Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The four classifications methods include two subjective approaches: self-reported subjective cognitive decline (Self-SCD) and informant-reported subjective cognitive decline (Inform-SCD); and two objective approaches: a sensitive neuropsychological individual test-based approach called objectively-defined subtle cognitive decline (Obj-SCD) and a composite score-based approach using the preclinical Alzheimer\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u0082\\u00ac\\u00e2\\u0084\\u00a2s cognitive composite to identify subtle cognitive decline (PACC-SCD). The specific aims of this proposal include: 1) Compare AD biomarkers across 4 subtle cognitive decline definitions (Self-SCD, Inform-SCD, Obj-SCD, and PACC-SCD); 2) Determine which subtle cognitive decline definitions best capture objective cognitive decline in the year preceding the subtle cognitive decline classification; and 3) Examine longitudinal a) clinical and b) biomarker progression across subtle cognitive decline definitions to determine the definitions with the best predictive utility. Results of the proposed aims will likely impact the design of future studies, as having simple, yet reliable, and highly cost- efficient methods for narrowing the initial pool of participants so that only those at greatest risk require a PET scan for screening purposes would result in significant cost-savings. Additionally, these results will serve as critical preliminary data for future grant applications, and be a key step toward improving clinically meaningful early detection methods of those at risk for future decline, particularly those with limited access to AD biomarker testing.--PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of individuals at risk for future progression to mild cognitive impairment and dementia is critical to engaging in early interventions that may slow, delay, or reduce the risk for future decline as well as for optimizing clinical trial recruitment.

Determination of the best approach will likely have important impacts on prospective design of future studies and, ultimately, clinical care and prevention.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Normal aging is typically associated with pervasive declines in cognitive, motor and sensory function; however, there are substantial individual differences: some older adults experience mild impairments while others experience severe cognitive declines. Understanding the neural bases of individual differences during aging is imperative in designing future interventions to address age-related cognitive impairments. Using behavioral testing, functional MRI, spectroscopy and pharmacological manipulations in human adults, I propose to investigate the scope, cause and consequences of age-related decline in two neural factors that may play a role in these individual differences: (1) neural distinctiveness (how similar\\/confusable neural activation patterns are in response to different stimulus categories) and (2) brain signal variability (moment-to-moment change in neural activity independent of task). Both these measures have been found to decline with age and both have been associated with individual differences in behavior. During the predoctoral (F99) phase of the training, my research will focus on healthy aging: 1) investigating the scope and cause (specifically role of GABA levels) of age-related decline in neural distinctiveness in sensory regions, 2) the cause of age-related declines in brain signal variability, and 3) the behavioral consequences of age-related declines in these two neural measures. During the postdoctoral (K00) phase, I will extend my previous research to again study neural distinctiveness and brain signal variability, but now in the context of memory and hippocampal dysfunction, and in a clinical population (patients with mild cognitive impairment, MCI). I will use task-based fMRI to measure neural distinctiveness, resting-state fMRI to measure brain signal variability, and MR spectroscopy to measure levels of various neurotransmitters (including glutamine, glutamate, NAA, and GABA), all in the hippocampus, in healthy younger and older adults as well as MCI patients. I will also collect behavioral data from the same participants during the mnemonic similarity task (MST), a highly sensitive measure of hippocampal dysfunction. I propose to investigate a) age-related changes in neural distinctiveness and resting state variability in the hippocampus, b) the neurochemical basis of these neural changes, and c) the behavioral and pathological consequences of these neural changes. For the MCI patients, I will also have access to a rich dataset of other biomarkers (e.g., longitudinal measures of CSF and PET-based amyloid and tau) collected at UCI?s Alzheimer?s disease research center (ADRC). I will therefore be able to examine neural distinctiveness and brain signal variability in the context of the amyloid tau neurodegeneration (biomarker profiling) framework. Together, this research could lead to the development of preclinical markers for Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and open new avenues for early pharmacological interventions to treat cognitive decline in healthy and pathological aging.--Some people age significantly more gracefully than others and understanding the neural factors that underlie those individual differences could lead to interventions to slow or even stop age-related behavioral impairments. The objective of this project is to investigate two neural factors that may play a role; namely age-related changes in the distinctiveness of neural representations and age-related changes in the variability of neural signals. This research could lead to the development of better preclinical markers of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and open avenues for pharmaceutical interventions to slow cognitive decline in aging.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project summary Throughout the day, the brain captures snapshots of distinct, instantaneous experiences, forming episodicmemories that often last a lifetime. These types of single-shot memories require the hippocampus and theentorhinal cortex ? a circuit collectively called the hippocampal formation. Disruptions of this brain region areinvolved in several devastating memory disorders, including Alzheimer?s disease. In spite of extensive study, westill lack basic understanding of how activity in the hippocampus implements memory functions. Neuroscience has amassed impressive knowledge about neural firing patterns in the hippocampal formation,including those of place cells and grid cells. Yet, these cells are best understood in static conditions, once ananimal has learned an environment and has been extensively trained on a behavioral task. We lack a clearconnection between hippocampal activity and dynamic processes of memory formation and recall. How doeshippocampal activity change when a new memory is formed? How are these firing patterns interpreted by otherbrain regions when a memory is recalled? These questions are challenging to address because the hippocampalformation is anatomically extremely complex, and because episodic memory-guided behaviors are particularlydifficult to study in standard laboratory model organisms. In this project, we seek to overcome major challenges to hippocampal research by using a unique modelorganism that is an extreme memory specialist ? the chickadee. These birds cache thousands of food items atscattered, hidden locations in their environment and use memory to retrieve their caches later in time. Theirbehavior is readily produced in the lab and contains well-defined moments of memory formation (caching) andrecall (cache retrieval). The repeatable and streamlined structure of food caching provides an opportunity tostudy neural activity underlying these memory processes. Cache memory requires the avian hippocampalformation, which is embryologically homologous to its mammalian counterpart and shares similar circuitorganization. However, the avian hippocampus is anatomically simpler and has a small number of well-defined,compact, and thus easily targetable inputs and outputs. The proposed project will obtain recordings of the hippocampus while chickadees are actively caching andretrieving food. This will allow us to relate hippocampal activity to discrete memory processes and to obtain aninterpretable neural signature of episodic memories. By leveraging chickadee anatomy, this project will alsodetermine what information is conveyed by hippocampal outputs to identified targets in the brain during memoryrecall. The ultimate goal is to obtain a complete circuit-level understanding of episodic memory. Because of theclose correspondence between our system and the mammalian hippocampus, these findings will inform otherfields and will generalize to hippocampal systems in other organisms that use memory, including humans.--Project narrativeThe proposed project aims to acquire a neural circuit-level understanding of how memories of everyday events;known as ?episodic? memories; are formed and recalled in the brain. This function relies on the hippocampalformation ? a brain region whose disruption results in a variety of memory disorders like Alzheimer?s disease.Our approach is to use the highly specialized and complex memory behavior of food caching birds to understandthe relationship between memories and neural activity in the hippocampal formation.\"}]", "httpMethod": "POST"}
