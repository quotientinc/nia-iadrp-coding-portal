Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is crucial for memory functionsand recovery from stress in rodents. Little is known about human AHN in healthy aging and Alzheimer?s Disease(AD), less is known about age and AD effects on synaptic plasticity and brain circuits. In aging rodents and non-human primates, adult-generated neural cells tend to favor differentiation into glia instead of neurons, butphylogenetic differences dictate human studies. AHN studies require rigorous methods for visualization of AHNmarkers and data interpretation. These include assuring brain tissue quality, standardized tissue processing, useof brain toxicology and neuropathology, and strict clinical inclusion\\/exclusion criteria based on adequate clinicaldata. We and others have confirmed persistent AHN with aging in subjects without AD, but we found age-associated declines in angiogenesis and neuroplasticity as defined by expression of polysialiated cell adhesionmolecule (PSA-NCAM) in fewer cells of the dentate gyrus (DG), which could reflect changes at the dendrite,spine or synaptic level, because PSA-NCAM is expressed with dendrite remodeling, neuron migration, and longterm potentiation. Our preliminary data show that Kruppel Like Factor 9 (Klf9), a transcription factor necessaryfor neurogenesis-dependent synaptic plasticity and neuronal differentiation, declines with normal aging in humanDG. We reported that the age-related angiogenesis decline is directly proportional to fewer cells expressing PSA-NCAM. Angiogenesis and AHN are regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), andwe have pilot data showing fewer intra- and extra-vascular DG cells expressing VEGFR2 in older people. Studiesof AHN in AD have shown conflicting findings of increased, no change, and deficits of AHN correlating withcognitive decline. We propose new techniques that have never been applied to study AHN, dendrite, spine,synaptic and vascular plasticity in normal human aging or AD brain tissue. To understand what sustains AHNand synaptogenesis, we will examine their relationship to expression of molecular regulators (Klf9 and VEGFR2).The sample will include hippocampi from the Brain Banks of NIMH and the New York AD Research Center: 80without neuropsychiatric illness, neuropathology or psychotropic drug use, age 14-90, and 20 with AD, age 65-90. Aims: 1. To study the neuronal or glial phenotype of doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells and quantify AHN andgliogenesis across the human lifespan. 2. To study age-associated changes in dendrite, spine and synapsesand their molecular regulator Klf9 in CA1, CA3 and DG: 2a. Golgi-stained dendrite and spines; 2b. Number andlength of neurofilament-immunoreactive dendrites; 2c. Pre\\/post-synaptic and dendritic protein expression:SYN1, PSD95 and spinophilin; 2d. Klf9 mRNA levels. 3. To assess age-associated angiogenesis decline andVEGFR2 levels in DG-CA regions. 4. To examine AHN and neurovascular plasticity changes in AD (as in Aim1-3). 5. To test how stress, BMI, and GAS correlate with AHN and neurovascular plasticity across the lifespan.--Project NarrativeIn 2050; the population aged 65 yrs. and over will be almost double the number in 2012; increasing theimportance of late life cognitive health and resilience; which in animals depends on new neuron production inthe hippocampus (hippocampal neurogenesis); their number of connections in brain circuits; and brain bloodflow. We and others have shown that new neurons are made in the hippocampus throughout life in medicallyhealthy people; but we don?t know how well connected with other neurons these new neurons become; becausewe found a decline in brain blood vessels with age and need to know if this is reversible with treatment. In thisproject; we will study the growth of new neurons; examine how stem cells separate off into other types of cellsand measure connectivity and blood vessel health in normally aging individuals compared to Alzheimer?sDisease.\"}]",
